Following this, Blue Lives Matter became a pro-police movement in the United States. It expanded after the killings of American police officers.\nOn December 20, 2014, in the wake of the killings of officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, a group of law enforcement officers formed Blue Lives Matter to counter media reports that they perceived to be anti-police. Blue Lives Matter is made up of active and retired law enforcement officers. The current national spokesman for Blue Lives Matter is retired Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Lieutenant Randy Sutton.\nOriginating in New York City in December 2014, Blue Lives Matter NYC is an organization and current nationwide movement that was created to help law enforcement officers and their families during their times of need. Sergeant Joey Imperatrice, along with Officers Chris Brinkley and Carlos Delgado, felt 'compelled to show support for their brothers and sisters in blue' and handed out bracelets that stated 'Blue Lives Matter'. They decided to create an organization, which became the non-profit Blue Lives Matter NYC. This organization's mission is to raise awareness and encourage public aid for the needs of police officers, to help police officers assist one another, and to provide a police officer's family with comfort and support during difficult times. This campaign is designed to raise both awareness and money for families in need. In order to increase nationwide awareness, over three hundred billboards have been posted with the slogan 'Blue Lives Matter'. Many of these billboards are also accompanied by the hashtag #thankublu, which individuals use to show their support for police officers.\nBlue Lives Matter is a pro-police movement in the United States. It was started after the killings of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in Brooklyn, New York, on December 20, 2014, after they were ambushed in their patrol car. Blue Lives Matter was formed in reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement, which seeks to end police brutality against the African American community."""
