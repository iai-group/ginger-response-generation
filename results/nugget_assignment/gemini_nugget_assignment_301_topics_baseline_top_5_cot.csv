The fact that you have hot flashes, sore joints, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and other symptoms all can indicate that some sort of infection is ongoing. Your doctor should be able to help you by recommending the appropriate treatment and testing that is needed to determine what is causing your symptoms.

WBCs are an important part of your immune system. They help you fight infection and are most effective when their numbers fall within a certain range. A WBC count that’s too low means that you’re at risk for infection. Your doctor will monitor your WBC during treatment to make sure that it doesn’t get too low. Your WBC is so important that if treatment causes it to drop too far, your doctor will temporarily stop the treatment. Once your WBC returns to safe levels, cancer treatment can resume. Tell your doctor right away if you experience any signs of low WBC count, which include: chills\nfever\nsweating\nSelf-care is always important, but even more so if you have a low WBC count.

Lee/The New York Times\nBased on a convoluted formula that takes into account inflation and the average price of meals sold in schools, certain districts — like New York City, where lunch is sold for $1.50 — did not have to raise prices this year. But next year, it could be different, unless the districts decide to use their own money to subsidize lunches. The mandatory increases in meal prices are “a recognition that over time, the money coming in to schools from the sale of paid meals has not kept pace with the cost of preparing those meals,” said Kevin Concannon, under secretary for food, nutrition and consumer services at the Department of Agriculture, which oversees the school meal program. “ The consideration here is the transition and giving school districts time to make the adjustments that they need to serve healthier meals to all our kids.” But Eric Goldstein, who oversees the New York City schools’ food program, said the law “misses the point.” Price increases threaten to upend the delicate balance of school food operations, Mr. Goldstein said, as they might compel more parents to pack their children’s lunches or to skip on paying cafeteria lunch fees altogether — already a huge problem, with the city absorbing $42 million in unpaid fees since 2004. Mr. Concannon, of the Agriculture Department, said the bill “seeks to ensure that the level of support for all school meals is equal.”', 'Last year, the cost of lunch for elementary and high school students went up 50 cents to between $2.50 and $2.75 to make up for increasing costs. Sales dropped by 10 percent. The same thing happened across the nation as school lunch prices increased. A Government Accountability Office study found 1.2 million fewer students across the country bought school lunches between the 2010-11 and 2012-13 school years. Federally required lunch-price increases and new nutrition standards likely fueled the change, the study found. School lunches are still a bargain. Even as prices have gone up and meals have gotten healthier, local schools charge less for student lunches than what they cost to prepare. There are few places you can get a healthy kids meal with an entree, fruits and vegetables, and milk for under $3. “A school lunch is still a good value for the meal that’s provided,” said Anne Rich, food service director in Grand Island.

Firstly, inflationary pricing has impacted basic food items essential to school meals, including a significant increase in the price of milk and bread. This inflation is leading schools to contemplate expense reductions, which may include cutting back on higher-quality options like organic and locally sourced ingredients that have been increasingly included in school lunches. Additionally, due to these financial strains, schools might have to make tough choices about the variety and quality of food offered while struggling to adhere to mandatory nutrition guidelines with a shrinking budget. This economic pressure could force schools to simplify meal offerings to cheaper alternatives, potentially impacting the overall quality of school lunches.;['Inflation increases school lunch costs', 'Higher food prices affect menu options', 'Schools may cut healthy options', 'Healthier options are more expensive', 'Government reimbursements don’t cover costs', 'Many schools already operate at a loss', 'Rising costs necessitate price increases', 'Increased food costs impact nutrition', 'Processed foods are cheaper', 'Schools rely on heavily processed foods', 'Higher food costs affect smaller districts more', 'Increased standards make participation challenging', 'Reduced revenue for some schools', 'Labor costs increase school lunch expenses', 'Inflation impacts fresh produce availability', 'Reduced-price lunch programs are underfunded', 'Privatization linked to lower test scores', 'Private firms prioritize profit over nutrition', 'Outsourced food service offers less healthy options'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital'];['support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support'];0.5

They are wrong because they have never met the enemy.” ― Julian Assange, Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet\ntags:', 'It seems it is the Internet that is primarily targeted whenever one party reacts. This sort of struggle between governments and the people is not ending anytime soon, and it can, and may, have huge repercussion with the presence of the Internet in the near future if things escalated. Now, with that being said, and since globalization is pushing us towards a single one-world government, let us apply this small incident of Egypt on a larger scale. What would happen if all citizens were at odds with the governments over power? Similarly, what if the Internet granted citizens unconditional freedom that would threaten the firm grasp governments have over their people? Wouldn’t the Internet be susceptible of being the cost of this struggle for control? Wouldn’t it be, and maybe it is, the battlefield that is at the risk of its own destruction? Weapons by nature inherently bear the seeds of their own destruction, and the Internet is being used as a weapon– a very vulnerable one. No one would care about the survival of the Internet as long as its survival intervenes with one’s own interests. Internet after all is not without enemies.', 'The electric motor, internal combustion engine, fluorescent and incandescent lighting, and the Internet have had enormous effects on the way we live and work. Emerging technologies such as cryogenics, photovoltaics, aerogels, fuel cells, and radio-wave lighting may do the same in the future. When legislators pass laws that restrict or forbid the use of technology, they grant a privilege to stagnant firms and their workers at the expense of the firms that would have used the new technology and the workers who would have had different, often better jobs. Resources remain in inefficient protected technological processes, creating waste and impeding progress. Calls for protectionism come from firms that have not modernized their production processes and thus are unable to compete with more efficient, lower-cost companies. Both mandated compensation to displaced laborers and restrictions on the use of technology will reduce the profits of the firms affected, thereby reducing capital accumulation and its re-investment that would have led to an eventual increase in the level of employment. Friends and Enemies of Progress\nVirginia Postrel’s 1998 book, The Future and Its Enemies, defies conventional political boundaries of left and right and liberal and conservative to divide the world into dynamists and stasists. The book’s thesis is that the most useful and pertinent intellectual concept is about those who welcome the future and those who want to stop, turn back, or regulate change. According to Postrel, dynamists prefer an open-ended society where creativity and enterprise, operating under general and predictable rules, generate progress in unpredictable ways. Dynamists appreciate evolutionary processes such as market competition, playful experimentation, scientific inquiry, and technological innovation.', 'This isn’t a terrible thing, necessarily; it’s just progress. Plenty of people from generations that grew up without the internet are somewhat reasonably worried, as more and more information becomes readily available, that we might not need to use our brains as much for storage as we used to. While there may be some truth behind those fears, they’re also nothing new. During the time of the great philosopher Socrates, the notion of the written word was gaining some significant traction. Socrates and plenty of his contemporaries decried the movement toward written language as a giant leap backwards for the human intellect, and he forbade his students from transcribing his teachings. Of course, we now know that Plato secretly shirked this order and wrote down a tremendous amount of his experiences with the great philosopher, leading to the bevy of Platonic texts that rely on his teachings. Despite Socrates’ warnings, written language did little to kill our brains, and — combined with the printing press — the written word is arguably one of the few things that have given humanity an intellectual and evolutionary leap forward. Harnessing fire was another such development, and so, too, according to many, is the development of the internet.

The passage outlines concerns about the internet becoming a battleground for control and a tool for potential totalitarianism due to global surveillance capabilities.

The passage indicates that while Western approaches to personality studies have been predominant, they often fail to fully capture the personality constructs of other cultures.

For example, had the Islamic and Arab nations succeeded in defeating the Christian nations in their religious efforts, the European culture would have had a very dramatic change. Artwork would be different, religious dominance and power distribution would be swayed in favor of Islam, and even the common language would have become Arabic.

Exporting e-waste, including hazardous and toxic materials, is leading to serious health hazards for the workers working for dismantling electronic devices in countries without adequate environmental controls. Currently, 50%–80% of e-waste that recyclers collect is exported overseas, including illegally exported e-scrap, which is of particular concern. 8 Overall, the inadequate management of electronics recycling in developing countries has led to various health and environmental problems.

State e-waste recycling laws cover 65% of the U.S. population, and some states, including California, Connecticut, Illinois, and Indiana, e-waste is banned from landfills.

"" Average Number of Connected Devices in U.S. Households 2020 .""', 'When it comes to recycling, anything is possible,” says Kuehr. “ It’s a question of whether it’s economic.” One of the hardest steps in e-waste recycling is simply getting the battery or other critical-metal-rich components out of the larger device or machine. This is a menial but intricate task, which is often handed over to low-paid workers in places like China or Nigeria. In the Guiyu area of southern China, for example, more than 100,000 people work to take apart e-waste, boiling up circuit boards to remove the plastic and then leaching the metals with acid, at great risk to the environment and themselves. Uncontrolled burning leads to contaminated groundwater, and one study found elevated levels of lead in children living in Guiyu. Japan is at the forefront of efforts to automate these processes so they can be done economically and safely by machines, says King. The onus has to be put on the manufacturers to recover and recycle their own products, one researcher notes. Even more important than technology, says Apelian, is policy and education. In a study of the U.S. recycling rates of about 20 products, from plastic to metal, the one with the highest rate of recovery is lead-acid batteries, used primarily in cars.', '5\nThe Electronics Recycling Process\nElectronics recycling can be challenging because discarded electronics devices are sophisticated devices manufactured from varying proportions of glass, metals, and plastics. The process of recycling can vary, depending on the materials being recycled and the technologies employed, but here is a general overview. Collection and Transportation: Collection and transportation are two of the initial stages of the recycling process, including for e-waste. Recyclers place collection bins or electronics take-back booths in specific locations and transport the collected e-waste from these sites to recycling plants and facilities. Shredding, Sorting, and Separation: After collection and transportation to recycling facilities, materials in the e-waste stream must be processed and separated into clean commodities that can be used to make new products. Efficient separation of materials is the foundation of electronics recycling. Shredding the e-waste facilitates the sorting and separation of plastics from metals and internal circuitry, and waste items are shredded into pieces as small as 100mm to prepare for further sorting. A powerful overhead magnet separates iron and steel from the waste stream on the conveyor and then prepares it for sale as recycled steel.']";The recycling of e-waste faces several key challenges. Firstly, a substantial portion of e-waste is exported to developing nations, where lax environmental regulations lead to serious health hazards for workers dismantling devices. Secondly, the decreasing quality and value of recycled materials from e-waste, due to devices containing less precious metal and being designed in ways that are not easily recyclable, repairable, or reusable, hinder the economic feasibility of recycling programs. Lastly, current global market conditions have depressed prices for recycled commodities, leading to decreased profit margins and consequent business closures in the recycling industry.

Let’s look at a few main issues:', ""For a start, there are laws that prohibit employment discrimination because of age. In addition, there are a few strategies you can use to help mitigate age discrimination issues. What is Employment Discrimination? Employment discrimination happens when a job seeker or an employee is treated unfavorably because of his or her race, skin color, national origin, gender, gender identity, disability, religion, sexual orientation, or age. The Gray Ceiling\nWhat is the “gray ceiling” and why does it matter? The gray ceiling is a term used to describe the age discrimination that many older job seekers and employees face while they’re searching for jobs or seeking promotions. Even though employers aren’t supposed to discriminate based on how old you are, getting hired can be a challenge when you’re considered to be an “older” worker. And you don't need to have gray hair to be considered too old to get hired. Percentage of Older People in the Workforce\nWhen the House of Representatives voted unanimously to repeal the Social Security earnings cap in an amendment to the 2000 “Senior Citizens’ Freedom To Work Act,” their rationale was that removing the previous earnings limit would enable more older Americans to return to work. As of 2018, 40% of people age 55 or older were actively working in the U.S. 1 \ufeff And by February 2019, about 20% of people over the age of 65 were working according to analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data."", '1.

Older workers are less flexible, less motivated, too slow, they take more sick days, etc. These are just a few of the many stereotypes people – older workers included – have about senior workers. As such, bias is one of the toughest aging workforce challenges. Now, how to beat these misconceptions? Germany’s Daimler – the company who owns Mercedes – has taken it upon themselves to challenge stereotypes about aging by developing an exhibition. Visitors of the exhibition can either enter the exhibition through a ‘young’ or an ‘old door’. Once inside, they can take tests to measure things like their balance, their ability to work in a team and their memory. The Reuters correspondent who wrote an article about Daimler’s initiative, real age 45, turned out to have a biological age of 36 and 119 years of life experience.', 'But there’s one issue that’s still very much present in America’s workforce. Ageism. Despite the fact that older employees are often the most knowledgeable and experienced members of the workforce, they’re all too often overlooked in favor of younger, less experienced workers. We’re going to shed some light on the issue by delving into some cold hard facts on ageism in the workplace, including who and how it affects our evolving workforce.

This approach theoretically allows diverse views to appear in the media. However, the person organizing the report still has the responsibility to choose people who really represent the breadth of opinion, to ask them non-prejudicial questions, and to edit or arbitrate their comments fairly. When done carelessly, a point/counterpoint can be just as unfair as a simple biased report, by suggesting that the “losing” side lost on its merits. Another technique used to avoid bias is the disclosure of affiliations that may be considered a possible conflict of interest. This is especially apparent when a news organization is reporting a story with some relevancy to the news organization itself or to its ownership individuals or conglomerate.

See how sea-level rise from global warming puts New York City at risk —and find other hot spots threatened by rising seas on the Climate Hot Map. Two major mechanisms are causing sea level to rise. First, shrinking land ice, such as mountain glaciers and polar ice sheets, is releasing water into the oceans. Second, as ocean temperatures rise, the warmer water expands. Trapped within a basin bounded by the continents, the water has nowhere to go but up. In some parts of the world, especially low-lying river deltas, local land is sinking (known as subsidence)—making sea levels that much higher. The consequences of sea level rise include: Threats to coastal communities. Some 40 percent of the world's population lives within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of the ocean, putting millions of lives and billions of dollars' worth of property and infrastructure at risk."", 'A warmer climate causes sea level to rise via two mechanisms: ( 1) melting glaciers and ice sheets (ice on land) add water to the oceans, raising the sea level, and (2) ocean water expands as it warms, increasing its volume and thus also raising sea level. During the 20th Century, sea levels rose about 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches). Thermal expansion and melting ice each contributed about half of the rise, though there is some uncertainty in the exact magnitude of the contribution from each source. By the year 2100, models predict sea level will rise between 30 and 100 cm (12 to 39 inches) depending on how much we are able to reduce the amount of climate warming. Acidic Ocean Water: Earth’s oceans are predicted to act as a buffer against climate change by taking up some of the excess heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This is good news in the short run, but more problematic in the long run. Carbon dioxide combined with seawater forms weak carbonic acid. Scientists believe this process has reduced the pH of the oceans by about 0.1 pH since pre-industrial times.', ""Well, we're looking for good writers who want to spread the word. Get in touch with us and we'll talk...\nLet's Work Together! The sea level is rising at about 3 mm every year around the globe, and oceanic research indicates that it is more or less higher than the rise in level that took place in the last millennium and before. Such processes can largely affect the coastal areas and island regions as well as inland areas located near the coasts. Entire cities and towns along with the marine ecosystem are greatly affected even by a slight increase in the sea level. Causes of Sea Level Rise\nThermal Expansion\nGlobal warming not only causes the temperature on land to increase, but also leads to an increase in sea water warming. This warming started mainly during the industrial evolution, and intensified when more and more trees were being cut down. Thermal expansion also affects the movement of hot and cold oceanic currents around the globe, and even a slight shift in the direction and temperature of any major current can have large-scale effects, especially on the sea level rise. Due to this, the water expands and its volume increases. This leads to a periodic rise in sea levels."", 'How is sea level rise related to climate change? How is sea level rise related to climate change? A warming climate can cause seawater to expand and ice over land to melt, both of which can cause a rise in sea level. Storm surge on a Louisiana highway shows the effects of rising sea levels. Many people are interested in climate change and how a changing climate will affect the ocean. With the majority of Americans living in coastal states, rising water levels can have potentially large impacts. Scientists have determined that global sea level has been steadily rising since 1900 at a rate of at least 0.04 to 0.1 inches per year. Sea level can rise by two different mechanisms with respect to climate change. First, as the oceans warm due to an increasing global temperature, seawater expands—taking up more space in the ocean basin and causing a rise in water level. The second mechanism is the melting of ice over land, which then adds water to the ocean.']";The mechanisms behind sea level rise primarily involve thermal expansion of ocean water and the melting of ice over land. As global temperatures rise due to human-induced climate change, the ocean water warms and expands, increasing its volume and raising sea levels. Simultaneously, glaciers, ice caps, and polar ice sheets melt, adding more water to the oceans.

Lactase is produced by the cells lining your small intestine, and if they don’t produce enough, the lactose you consume passes undigested into the large intestine. There, it interacts with bacteria and causes all those nasty stomach problems — diarrhea, gas, bloating — that those with lactose intolerance know all too well. Lactose intolerance could be caused by anything that disrupts the functioning of the small intestine — for example, surgery, an illness such as Crohn’s disease or even food poisoning.

Sometimes it's genetics, but other triggers include food poisoning, extreme stress, and cutting dairy out of your diet for long periods of time. It's important to work with a doctor or R.D. to determine if you're truly intolerant or have another dietary issue. Some people can redevelop tolerance slowly, while others will have to avoid lactose for life. It's every dairy-lover's worst nightmare: One day you’re eating cheese by the hunk and ice cream by the pint, and the next you can’t stomach a sip of milk without becoming as gassy as a football player on an all-broccoli diet.

Currently, over 50 percent of the population in the world is lactose intolerant. This is what happens when your lower intestine doesn't create enough lactase (and enzyme) to help process and digest the milk sugars which are called lactose. This intolerance may develop at any point in time from infancy to your golden years. It is often very challenging to diagnose as the symptoms often mimic symptoms of other conditions, including IBS or irritable bowel syndrome. Symptoms may include diarrhea, bloating, nausea, abdominal cramping and gas. What Causes Lactose Intolerance? When a person’s body doesn't digest lactose then he’s lactose intolerant. It can be caused when the body fails to produce enough lactase which is what breaks lactose down into glucose and galactose.""]";"Yes, someone can become lactose intolerant over a period of time.

Civil engineering careers are both rewarding and challenging and can involve construction, design and management, depending on your interests and specialist knowledge. This career option often involves many aspects of design and architecture, allowing you to express your creative side and explore innovative new ideas, whilst also analyzing data and technology. Civil engineers need a good knowledge of design and construction methods as well as health and safety matters. Civil engineering careers generally split into the roles of a consulting civil engineer and a contracting civil engineer. Civil engineering careers in consultancy are likely to be involved in the design stage of a project, collaborating with architects and other professionals. Alternatively, contracting civil engineers turn the plans of consulting civil engineers into reality, dealing with practical issues such as obtaining materials and meeting deadlines, and helping to resolve any problems that arise. There are also roles which combine both the consulting and contracting stages.

The Act prohibits the indiscriminate admission of persons to state institutions or the retention of persons without just cause. Named after former State Rep. Maxine Baker, the Act mandates that the courts appoint an attorney to represent those who are involuntarily placed in a mental health program and conduct independent reviews every six months of involuntary placements. Baker established a patients’ bill of rights, including protecting a person’s right to communicate with whomever they wished, to receive and send unopened mail, to use their own possessions and to vote. Baker expressly prohibits the placement of persons with mental illnesses in jail unless they have committed a criminal offense. Among the Baker Act’s intended purposes is to: Provide comprehensive services for those who need intensive short-term and continued treatment\nAdmit persons to facilities on a voluntary basis when extended or continuing care is needed and unavailable in the community\nEnsure that involuntary examinations or treatments are accomplished in appropriate settings that will help the person to return to the community\nProvide emergency service and temporary detention for evaluation when required\nEmploy the least restrictive means of intervention based on individual needs\nGuarantee that a person’s dignity and human rights when admitted to mental health facilities are protected\nOur Role\nThe role that the Office of the State Attorney plays in a Baker Act Hearing is to ensure that the person meets the Baker Act Criteria. The Assistant State Attorney calls witnesses, usually including one of the two doctors who evaluated the person determining that the person does in fact suffer from a mental illness, along with any family members or proposed guardian advocates (either a family member or a volunteer who takes a four-hour course to become certified). A guardian advocate is one who will, upon court approval and appointment, be allowed to talk to the treating physicians and ask questions about medication being prescribed or taken, the side effects of that medication and any additional information to aid the guardian in making an informed decision about the medications. The decision has to be informed and in the best interest of the patient and the patient only.', 'The Baker Act allows for the temporary detention and examination of people showing evidence of mental illness and who are in danger of harming themselves or others. This includes danger from self-neglect as well as physical harm. Although the official name is the Florida Mental Health Act of 1971, the statue is commonly called the Baker Act after one of the bill’s co-sponsors, former Florida state representative Maxine Baker. The Baker Act was aimed at preserving the rights of those who are involuntarily committed. It replaced the state’s previous mental health law originating in 1874, frequently referred to as “draconian.” The new statute set stringent criteria for invoking the Baker Act, as well as time limit on evaluations and for involuntary treatment requests based on those evaluations. Representation was now required for those who are Baker Acted, among other provisions. The Baker Act is sometimes confused with the Marchman Act. Florida’s Marchman Act also allows for involuntary evaluation and commitment, but it is for substance abuse treatment. By contrast, the Baker Act just deals with mental health.', 'How Do You Baker Act in Florida & Why Would You Want To? What Is the Baker Act in Florida? The Florida Baker Act law allows doctors, mental health professionals, judges, and law enforcement to commit a person to a mental health treatment center for up to 72 hours if they display certain violent or suicidal signs of mental illness. The purpose of the Baker Act is to allow time for a mental health evaluation to be performed and to de-escalate a crisis. This evaluation will confirm whether the individual is experiencing a mental health issue, and if the person is determined not to be a danger to themself or others, they will be released after the holding period. The act is named after former Florida representative Maxine Baker. It was established in the early 1970s as part of the Florida Mental Health Act. Notably, this act restored rights to many individuals with mental health issues by releasing those that were not a danger to themselves or others. But what does the Baker Act process look like?

A law enforcement officer takes the person into custody and transports them to a receiving mental health facility. 3. The individual is examined and placed on a psychiatric hold for no more than 72 hours. 4. The patient is given a mental health evaluation and further treatment is recommended based on the results. The Florida Mental Health Act provides an option for loved ones who recognize that action must occur before an individual hurts themselves or others. It is not uncommon for addicts and alcoholics to feel so hopeless and helpless that they turn to suicide. The Baker Act is a legal way to avoid this tragic end, and give assistance to a loved one when they cannot or will not make the decision for themselves.', 'Basics of the Florida Baker Act\nCase Management\nBasics of the Florida Baker Act\nFebruary 21, 2020\nShare\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nEmail\nThe Florida Mental Health Act, more commonly known as the Baker Act, was passed to allow for the creation of mental health programs designed to “reduce the occurrence, severity, duration, and disabling aspects of mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders.” Section 394.453, Florida Statutes. The Baker Act contains a variety of provisions ranging from screening to appointment of legal guardians. However, the Baker Act is most commonly known for the involuntary evaluation and confinement provisions. Being involuntarily confined for a mental health exam in Florida is commonly called being “Baker Acted.” The rights of a Baker Act patient are spelled out in Section 394.459, Florida Statutes. They include receiving a physical exam within 24 hours of arrival at the facility (sect. 394.459 (2) (c), Fla.

Which is why some centrist include themselves as socially libertarian rather than socially liberal and fiscally conservative, sometimes fiscally liberal.', ""Centrist that summarise their view as socially conservative and fiscally liberal would fundamentally be for bigger government, higher taxes, higher taxes on the rich, not be for gay marriage—would most likely believe marriage should exclusively be heterosexual—be against the legalisation of abortion, be against restrictions on purchasing a gun, in relation to environmental policies they would not be for it since they predominantly believe human contribution to climate change is not valid, or has been exaggerated. In terms of morals, centrist may have morals that seem more conservative—restrictions on drinking certain beverages, wearing clothing that can be associated with your deemed decency, being attached to traditional values —or morals that seem liberal—not restricting oneself to exploring sexual activity, being more open with their dressing in public being attached to less traditional values and progressive ones in replacement and furthermore. Centrist could also lean, but the term to be more adequate instead would be centre-left, or centre-right, those that are centre-left tend to be more left-leaning than right-leaning and identify more with left-wing parties, or register as independent but still have some right-leaning views, the simliar applies to those that identify as centre-right but it is basically the opposite. Centrist tend to believe in right or left leaning views but in more of a moderate approach rather than extreme, or an exclusive approach broken into two popular beliefs—conservative or liberal—they instead take views from both political spectrums and incorporate it to combination of a polictical belief that doesn't entirely align with the extreme left or extreme right spectrum.

Centrists believe that solutions are more important than bias. While there is no set rule for what a Centrist is, there are some generally accepted guidelines that seem to depict the Centrist mode of thought. Centrism is a political ideology based on reason and pragmatism considerate of short and long term thinking - Centrism is not defined by compromise or moderation, it is considerate of them. Centrism is about achieving common sense solutions that appropriately address current and future needs; support the public trust; and serve the common good with consideration of risk and capacity in context of these needs. Modern definitions sometimes conflate Centrism with moderation but the Centrist Party tenets generally oppose moderate views.

They believe in pragmatism and reasoning in decision-making, which likely extends to their views on presidential powers, suggesting they support a balanced approach where such powers are not excessive but sufficient for effective governance. Additionally, centrists’ disdain for political spin and special interests further implies their advocate for a transparent and straightforward exercise of presidential authority, ensuring that the integrity of governance is maintained and actions are primarily in public interest, rather than being influence-driven.;"['Checks and balances on presidential power', 'Constitutional limits on presidential power', 'Oppose exceeding constitutional limits', 'Oppose abuse of presidential power', 'Presidential power subject to Congressional oversight', 'Executive power shared, not separated', 'President’s power: persuasion, reputation, prestige', 'Constitutional powers: limited but significant', 'Framers intended Congress to lead, President to execute', 'Growth of executive power over time', 'Presidential power depends on leadership, events, public opinion', 'Limited government, careful about exceeding authority', 'Congress declares war; President commands', 'President accountable to all citizens', 'Respect for checks and balances', 'No absolute authority over domestic policy', 'Powers articulated in Article II of the Constitution', 'Congress, judiciary, states also have powers', 'President is not a king', 'Impeachment for abuse of power', 'Treaty-making requires Senate approval', 'Veto power subject to Congressional override', 'Commander-in-chief, but Congress declares war', 'Believe in rule of law, accountability', 'Reject using military as political props', 'Free press essential for accountability', 'Facts and science guide policy', 'No one above the law']";['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital'];['not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support'];0.35

This partnership provides students with more opportunities to learn and grow from a larger range of viewpoints and life experiences. Through open communication and collaboration, parents and teachers create important opportunities for teens to develop social, emotional, and academic skills. School involvement makes a difference. The Benefits of School-Family Partnerships\nWhen teachers and families partner together to support student achievement, students earn higher grades, attend school more regularly, and enroll in higher level courses. This collaboration also fosters more motivated students. Young people maintain higher educational aims and lower rates of dropout. Students with involved parents have better attendance, complete more homework, and have higher enrollment in educational opportunities after high school. Parents can participate at school by helping with functions and activities, or communicating with teachers. They can also be involved at home in many ways, including guiding their children to manage homework and other commitments and engaging in discussions about values and attitudes regarding education.', 'OCT, Educational Consultant, LDAO\nIntroduction\nParents are vital partners in education. They influence their children’s attitudes about learning, and support learning at home. They are a vital link between home and school. And when they become involved in the life of the school, they make our schools better places to learn, grow and thrive. Ontario’s parent engagement policy recognizes that student achievement and success increase when parents are welcomed and respected as partners, and given the support they need to contribute at home and at school. - Parents in Partnership, Ministry of Education, 2010\nEducators and parents generally agree that positive, supportive and open relationships between home and school, parent and teacher are desirable. Additionally, research has shown that parent engagement and successful parent-teacher partnerships result in improved educational outcomes for students (Ministry of Education, 2010), and this is especially important for students with learning disabilities (LDs). So what can educators and administrators do to help facilitate a positive partnership? Developing a Positive Partnership\nLynn Ziraldo, Executive Director with the Learning Disabilities Association of York Region, maintains that a positive school climate can help professionals, parents, guardians, and educators work constructively together to address concerns related to programs and services before they become a source of conflict (Presentation, 2016). Ziraldo identifies the following steps to promoting a positive school climate:', 'Nobody knows a child better than his/her parents. When parents work together with the child\'s teacher, they can support the child\'s learning in a better way as both parents and teachers have the common goal to provide the best learning experience to the child. When parents partner with the child\'s teacher, they get a better understanding of the child\'s learning graph. Parents can always share their concerns regarding the performance of the child. These concerns can be the one which the teacher is not able to see. Moreover, at home children share what is happening at school and the problems they (children) are facing. Parents can talk about these with the teacher along with what else is happening with the child at home. While talking to Boldsky, Anu, a working woman in Patna said, ""Working together with my daughter\'s teacher helps me to gauge my child\'s performance. Whenever my daughter is frustrated with any lesson, I am able to know the same. After this, I and her teacher are able to discuss and find out a way to help my child.""', 'And parents and teachers benefit, too. When working together as partners, it’s been found that parents and teachers communicate more effectively, develop stronger relationships with one another and develop skills to support children’s behaviors and learning. “Building partnerships between families and schools is an effective strategy to address opportunity gaps, especially for those who have been historically underserved,” said Iheoma Iruka, co-principal investigator of ELN’s University of Nebraska-Lincoln team and chief research innovation officer and director of the Center for Early Education Research & Evaluation at HighScope Educational Research Foundation. “ Strong partnerships support children’s learning and ability to develop lifelong skills and networks, while also strengthening parents’ capacity to be engaged in their child’s school experience.” The Three C’s: How to form a constructive parent-teacher partnership\nPartnerships are most powerful when they include three main components, represented as the “3 C’s”: communication, consistency and collaboration. Communication\nThe first is communication between home and school. Like any relationship in life, communication between you and your child’s teacher is key. Communicate with your child’s teacher early on and throughout the school year.', ""Well, there is one more thing that can help children to perform well in the school and that is known as parent-teacher partnership. It is a relationship in which parents and teacher work together to discuss a child's progress and find out a way to help the child in dealing with the challenges faced during learning. When there is a good relationship between parents and child's teacher, there can be regular communication about the learning issues of the child. How Parent-Teacher Partnership Works\nThere are three angles to parent-teacher relationship. How parents get benefited: Nobody knows a child better than his/her parents. When parents work together with the child's teacher, they can support the child's learning in a better way as both parents and teachers have the common goal to provide the best learning experience to the child.

Firstly, they influence their children's attitudes towards learning and support their learning activities at home, playing a crucial role in shaping their educational experience and success. Secondly, by engaging in open communication with teachers, parents can share insights about their child’s progress and address potential issues that may not be apparent to teachers, thus enhancing the educational support the child receives. Finally, parents’ involvement in school activities and consistent collaboration with teachers help to create a positive learning environment that benefits both students and the school community as a whole.;['Parents communicate regularly with teachers.', 'Parents reinforce learning at home.', 'Parents help with homework and projects.', 'Parents share child’s strengths/challenges.', 'Parents attend school events and conferences.', 'Parents advocate for their child’s needs.', 'Parents collaborate with teachers on learning.', 'Parents monitor student progress and provide feedback.', 'Parents offer invaluable insights into their child.', 'Parents contribute to positive school culture.', 'Parents address learning gaps at home.', 'Parents build trust and open communication.', 'Parents provide a supportive home environment.', 'Parents share family skills/hobbies.'];['vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay'];['support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support'];0.7777777777777778

Like when you’re late for a meeting and can’t remember where you left your car keys? Or when you have to give a big presentation and suddenly forget all your talking points seconds before you start? There’s nothing like stress to make your memory go a little spotty. A 2010 study found that chronic stress reduces spatial memory: the memory that helps you recall locations and relate objects. Hence, your missing car keys. University of Iowa researchers recently found a connection between the stress hormone cortisol and short-term memory loss in older rats. Their findings, published in the Journal of Neuroscience this week, showed that cortisol reduced synapses – connections between neurons – in the animals’ pre-frontal cortex, the area of the brain that houses short-term memory. But there’s a difference between how your brain processes long-term job stress, for example, and the stress of getting into a car accident.', 'Research suggests low levels of anxiety can affect your ability to recall memories; acute or high-anxiety situations, on the other hand, can actually reinforce the learning process. Trust your memory? Maybe you shouldn’t\nAcute stress increases your brain’s ability to encode and recall traumatic events, according to studies. These memories get stored in the part of the brain responsible for survival, and serve as a warning and defense mechanism against future trauma.

Neuroscientists from the University of California, Berkeley, found that chronic stress can create long-term changes in the brain. Stress increases the development of white matter, which helps send messages across the brain, but decreases the number of neurons that assist with information processing. The neuroscientists say the resulting imbalance can affect your brain’s ability to communicate with itself, and make you more vulnerable to developing a mental illness.', ""Stress can inhibit the way we form and retrieve memories and can affect how our memory works. Fortunately, there is good news here to balance out the bad. Here is what research tells us about the effects of stress on memory. Stress and Memory\nStress can affect how memories are formed. When stressed, people have a more difficult time creating short-term memories and turning those short-term memories into long-term memories, meaning that it is more difficult to learn when stressed. Stress can affect the type of memories we form as well. If we are stressed during an event, we may have more difficulty accurately remembering the details of the event later, as the stress we felt colors our perceptions as well as our ability to recall what we perceived at the time. This is part of why eye-witness testimony is so unreliable—people can be absolutely sure they saw something a certain way, but this doesn't mean that they are correct. Memories can also change after they are formed.

The good news is that there was a short delay between encoding and the formation of memory. Also, if the material being learned was directly related to the stressor, memory actually improved. Even better, post-encoding stress actually improved memory formation and retrieval as well, meaning stress that occurred after the memory was formed actually led to better memory-making. 2 \ufeff\nStress increased cortisol, but the amount of cortisol was not directly related to the effects of stress on memory.

It is the very same feelings that victims of assault experience.', ""It is accomplished by sending victims an email containing a link to a website that the victims use regularly. The email asks victims to update their account information on the website, but when victims click on the link within the email, they are taken to a copycat website that secretly captures the information they enter. Online Stalking, Bullying, and Sex Crimes\nSome of the most serious computer crimes have nothing to do with making money, achieving political objectives, or showing off a hacker's skills. Instead, they are designed to cause emotional trauma to the victim. Social media websites provide offenders with the ability to publish hurtful or embarrassing material as a way of inflicting harm on others. Once photographs or other items are posted and circulated online, they can be impossible for the victim to remove. The fallout from these kinds of activities is especially devastating for school age children, who tend to be more sensitive to social harassment. A number of sexual offenses are also committed using computers. The trafficking of child pornography is one example. Federal and state authorities prosecute these cases vigorously, with convicted offenders often being sentenced to decades of incarceration.""]";When a cybercrime appeals to a victim, it typically engages the victim emotionally, creating long-lasting impacts whether the data is used or merely threatened to be misused. As highlighted by Howard, even the potential use of stolen data can be as traumatic as its actual misuse, evidenced by instances such as the Ashley Madison breach where the threat alone led to extreme consequences like suicide. The emotional distress includes feeling victimized, suffering from insomnia, eating disorders, and potentially leading to physical health issues, emphasizing the severe psychological impacts of cybercrimes.;['Exploits victim vulnerabilities', 'Appeals to emotions (fear, greed)', 'Builds trust, then deceives', 'Creates believable scenarios', 'Leverages social engineering', 'Manipulates victims into action', 'Requests personal data, money', 'Causes financial, emotional harm', 'Uses phishing, malware, scams', 'Impersonates trusted entities', 'Creates false sense of urgency', 'Threatens negative consequences', 'Psychological manipulation', 'Pretexting, quid pro quo schemes', 'May resell stolen data', 'Causes reputational damage', 'Compromises sensitive data', 'Targets specific victims', 'Promises unrealistic rewards', 'Disrupts services/operations', 'Extorts victims for ransom', 'Uses deceptive emails/messages', 'Demands financial payments', 'Inflicts psychological distress'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay'];['not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support'];0.1875

Some of the region's new or newish presidents are of the moderate, social-democratic left. They include Lula, Ms Bachelet in Chile, Óscar Arias in Costa Rica and Tabaré Vázquez in Uruguay.

While they’re often explained as a reaction to liberal economic policies adopted in the continent during the previous decade, most research shows that the main determinants of populists’ success are in fact dissatisfaction with political institutions, led by the endemic corruption and/or bad governance observed in throughout the region. SR: Indeed, the rise of populism in Latin America after the Third Wave of Democratization has been closely related to declining trust levels in core representative institutions like parliaments and political parties since the 1990s, the so called “crisis of representation”. Hence, most successful populists in the region came to power against the background of a power vacuum in their political party systems – the most paradigmatic examples are Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia, Alberto Fujimori in Peru and Rafael Correa in Ecuador. 3) While in many countries populism is on the rise as a reaction to repeated scandals of corruption and low trust in political parties, this does not happen everywhere.

Mexico feared Spain would continue to have influence and power in California because most of the Spanish missions in California remained loyal to the Roman Catholic Church in Spain. As the new Mexican republic matured, calls for the secularization ("" disestablishment "") of the missions increased. Once fully implemented, the secularization act, called the Decree for the Secularisation of the Missions of the Californias, took away much of the California Mission land and sold it or gave it away in large grants called ranchos.

The missions were part of the first major effort by Europeans to colonize the Pacific Coast region, the most northern and western parts of Spain\'s North American land claims. The settlers introduced European fruits, vegetables, cattle, horses, ranching and technology into the Alta California region and to the Mission Indians. The El Camino Real road connected the missions from San Diego to Mission San Francisco Solano, in Sonoma, a length of 529 miles (851 km). Between 1683 and 1834, Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries established a series of religious outposts from today\'s Baja California and Baja California Sur into present-day California .']";When the Mexican government secularized authority, it enacted various measures to limit the church's power, which were both political and economic in nature. The secularization began in earnest with the Mexican Secularization Act of 1833, which repossessed lands from the missions and aimed to convert them into towns, shifting control from religious to civil authority. These actions led to significant conflicts, notably the expulsion of church properties and suppression of religious orders by President Benito Juárez in 1857, eventually sparking Mexico's first religious civil war between 1857 and 1860 as formalized in the 1857 Constitution.;['Church lost significant land, power, economic control', 'Mexican government confiscated Church land, property', 'Secularization weakened Catholic Church influence', 'Mission lands redistributed, often unevenly', 'Ranchos formed from former mission lands', 'Secularization led to mission abandonment, damage', 'Liberals aimed to curb Church power, economic control', '1833 secularization act transferred mission lands to pueblos', 'Failed land distribution to indigenous populations', 'Reform Laws limited Church power, economic control', 'Lerdo Law confiscated Church land, fueled conflict', 'Juárez Law restricted clerical privileges, sparked rebellion', 'Secularization impacted education, tithes, civil registry', '1857 Constitution separated church and state', 'Article 130 restricted Church activities, legal standing'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital'];['support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support'];0.9

Defendants have the burden of proving that the state violated its duty to preserve evidence, and that that violation compromised the rights to due process and a fair trial. Courts won’t do anything about an alleged violation unless the defendant proves that the evidence in question was material and potentially exculpatory and that the government acted in bad faith. In practice, it’s very difficult to prove these points. Proving materiality\nIn order to prove that the evidence was material, the defendant must establish that\nlaw enforcement officers had reason to believe the evidence was exculpatory before they destroyed it, and\nthe evidence can’t be replaced by other reasonably available evidence. Courts can sometimes infer materiality from law enforcement’s actions. For example, the fact that the state normally preserves the type of evidence that it destroyed in the defendant’s case may show that the evidence was material. Similarly, the government testing, using, or intending to test or use the evidence provides a strong indication that it recognized the importance of that evidence. Proving bad faith\nProving bad faith is tough. It’s not enough that government actors were careless or negligent with the evidence—the defendant must show willful, deceitful, or malicious intent.', 'Consequences of Losing or Destroying Evidence\nA court will not sanction the prosecution on its own if the prosecution loses or destroys evidence. A defendant or their attorney will need to raise the issue. They will need to show that the government acted in bad faith in violating the duty to preserve evidence, and they also need to show that the evidence was material and exculpatory, such that their right to a fair trial was violated. If the defendant succeeds, the court might suppress the related evidence or limit testimony about it. In some extreme cases, the court might even dismiss the case. If the issue does not arise until after a conviction, an appellate court might overturn the conviction and order a new trial. Proving bad faith requires showing intentional misconduct by the government, rather than mere carelessness. A failure to follow procedures can suggest bad faith, but it is a challenging standard to meet. Proving that the evidence was material requires showing that the government should have known that the evidence was exculpatory. The defense also needs to show that no other available evidence could have served the same purpose.', 'The Impact of Mishandled Evidence on the Accused - Tracker Products\nBlog\n« All Articles\nThe Impact of Mishandled Evidence on the Accused\nAugust 21, 2019\nWhen evidence is lost or destroyed, a court must decide guilt or innocence based solely on the witness’s unsubstantiated testimony for both the prosecution and defense. And if the evidence was exculpatory, the defendant will be negatively impacted, even if a new trial is ordered. Mishandled, damaged or lost physical or digital evidence can happen at any time during the chain of custody: at the crime scene, during the packaging, when transferring, and during evidence analysis and storage. While forensic scientists are sensitive to the issue of contamination and have developed protocols to identify and reduce these risks, law enforcement has been slower to incorporate precautions in contamination prevention. Sometimes, it’s not only the victims that suffer due to mishandled evidence, but the accused as well. Recently, the FBI admitted to decades of relying on faulty hair analysis in trials – a grave error in criminal proceedings. Among those convicted on fraudulent evidence, 32 defendants were sentenced to death, 14 of whom have either died in prison or had already been executed.

Did the government act in bad faith? If a judge finds that the missing evidence was not favorable, then he can still grant the motion if he determines that the government acted in bad faith. “ Bad faith ” means that the government intentionally destroyed or mishandled evidence. Note that the negligent handling of evidence will not rise to the level of bad faith. This rule also applies to the situation where evidence was lost or mishandled by the government’s accident.

As generic and easy as that sounds, this leaves a good deal of room for interpretation. If a person calmly reaches into their pocket, it’s certainly a physical act, but is it menacing? The answer will almost always depend on the particular facts and circumstances of a given case. In a recent case in New York City’s Manhattan Criminal Court, People v. Gayle, the defendant was accused of Menacing in the Third Degree pursuant to PL 120.15, and attempted to have the Court dismiss that charge based on the argument that the allegations, even if they were true, did not establish that his actions constituted “physical menace.”', ""danger, risk, threat, hazard, peril, jeopardy In my view you are a menace to the public. 2.

Edward T. Creagan, MD, an oncologist at the Mayo Clinic, says that in dealing with the emotions of grief, if you don’tface your grief, your wounds may never go away. “ Unresolved grief can surface years later as headaches, relationship issues, intestinal problems, mental health difficulties, eating disorders, chemical dependency or other issues,” he says. Additionally, holding in emotions can weaken your body’s immune system, making you more likely to get colds and other infections, as well as lead to the abuse of alcohol, tobacco or other drugs. The danger, experts agree, is that when we delay acknowledging our emotions, this can lead our body to speak louder and louder to get our attention.

How we Physically React to Stress\nBodies of all human beings (and animals alike) react to stress in basically the same manner. In 1944 Hans Selye a neurophysiologist formulated the three phases of stress reactions but it is only recently that scientists can identify with considerable accuracy what actually takes place. According to Selye the reaction to stress happens in three phases but for our purpose we will only discuss phase one. The first phase or the “alarm reaction” occurs immediately on contact with the stressor (grief at the death of our child). At the death the brain “translates” the stress of grief into a chemical reaction in the body.', 'Your Health and Grief\nYour Health and Grief\nMedically reviewed by Scientific Advisory Board — Written by Tom Gray on May 17, 2016\nThe loss of a loved one is a life-shattering experience.

Researchers believe this to be an adverse physiological response to serious grief. Adobe\nWhy Does Grief Affect Us This Way? The short answer? Grief interrupts our normal brain functioning, and our brain is in charge of sending signals to the rest of our body. Grief can cause changes in brain chemicals like dopamine and serotonin, says Dr. Richard Honaker, M.D., chief medical officer of Your Doctors Online. “These chemicals work in a fine balance to keep our moods and functioning smooth,” Honaker says. “ Grief throws them out of balance.” Grief affects our limbic system, which is the system of nerves and networks in the brain, as well as the pre-frontal cortex, Burnette explains.', 'Withholding permission to cry and express related emotions and thoughts blocks grief, and causes physiological  stress, which may culminate in numerous symptoms or ill-health conditions. People while grieving often feel extremely exhausted because the process of grieving usually requires physical and emotional energy. The grief they are feeling is not necessarily for the person who died, but also for the unfulfilled wishes and plans for the relationship with  that person. Death often reminds people of past losses or separations. If normal grieving is blocked, person feels ""depressed"" and/or ""irritable."" If this persists, or  that person accumulates too many un-grieved losses and repressed sadness and anger,  he (or she) may become addicted or physically sick (e.g. migraines, cancer, hypertension, diabetes...).

Have compassion for yourself. It's not your fault that you have stereotypes—they likely developed in the context of society and social networks that you largely had no control over in your early years. Educate yourself.

Any negative experiences that we have with a member of a particular group will strengthen our racial stereotypes and create fears about particular races.

Within an instant, your brain is trying to help you determine whether an individual is trustworthy and safe, or whether they likely pose some sort of emotional, social, or physical risk. And these judgments will affect how you feel and how you act. Many of your stereotypes were developed when you were a child. Here’s how some generalizations about race can likely be formed: When your teachers showed you famous scientists and historical figures, what race were most of the examples?

This is the sole reason why people are opting for air conditioning at their respective places to get some relief from scorching and blazing heat. But have you ever thought why it becomes tough for you to bear the heat outside after getting out of the air conditioned homes and workplaces? That’s because you stress your body to adjust between two extreme temperatures weakening your immune system. Let’s have a look on similar negative effects of air conditioning on your health. 1. Weaker Immunity\nAir conditioning creates an artificial change in temperature which is unhealthy for human immunity causing weakening of immune system. People who frequently switch between extreme temperatures by staying inside home and office and later outside in scorching heat fall sick more frequently for no apparent reason. 2. Feeling constantly fatigued\nWhen temperature of air conditioning is set very low, it causes internal shivering in a person’s body and when that individual works overtime it produces more heat causing constant fatigueness which is the most crucial negative health effect of air conditioning.', 'It just makes things even worse.

Therefore, it’s important to use it responsibly and not excessively.', 'The inability to deal with heat\nThose who spent a lot of time in an air conditioned environment become increasingly more intolerant of hot summer temperatures. This is mainly caused by the stress on your body from moving from a cool environment to the sweltering outdoor air. This intolerance of the heat has lead to an increase heat related deaths during heat waves, which now averages at 400 deaths each summer. 5. Breathing problems\nThough your car’s AC may be a saving grace while stuck in traffic on a hot day they are the worst offenders for circulating germs and micro-organisms that cause breathing problems. Researchers at Louisiana State Medical Center found eight types of mould living inside 22 out of 25 cars tested.

As with all forms of taxation, a regressive system offers certain advantages and disadvantages. Advertisement\nFreedom of Choice\nWhen a regressive tax is based on consumption such as a sales tax, it can introduce an element of freedom of choice. Only those who choose to use a particular product or service must pay the tax, and those who consume more frequently pay more taxes than occasional users. People also have some measure of control of how much they pay in taxes. If they wish to lower what they pay in taxes, they can elect to cut back on or discontinue the use of an item. Discouraging Consumption\nA regressive tax may be used to discourage people to avoid the use of potentially harmful products. A so-called ""sin tax"" on products like tobacco, alcohol and pornographic materials may make it more difficult for users of these products to afford their purchase, especially those at the lower end of the economic scale who need every dollar just to get by. Governments and municipalities may implement these taxes on the assumption that there will still be enough consumption of the products to generate needed revenues.

An individual earning $20,000 a year pays the same dollar amount in taxes on a purchase as an individual earning $200,000 per year. The end result is that the lower a person\'s income, the greater the proportion of that income that must be paid in taxes. Decreased Revenues\nAnother potential disadvantage of regressive taxation is that needed tax revenues could decrease if consumption decreases. This may occur during difficult economic times when consumers cut back on spending out of necessity. An increase in an existing tax may also cause consumers to reconsider whether they really need the product or service.', ""regressive tax | Definition, Examples, & Facts | Britannica\nHome Politics, Law & Government Banking & Business\nRegressive tax\nPrint\nGive Feedback\nExternal Websites\nWRITTEN BY\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica\nEncyclopaedia Britannica's editors oversee subject areas in which they have extensive knowledge, whether from years of experience gained by working on that content or via study for an advanced degree....\nSee Article History\nRegressive tax, tax that imposes a smaller burden (relative to resources) on those who are wealthier. Its opposite, a progressive tax, imposes a larger burden on the wealthy. A change to any tax code that renders it less progressive is also referred to as regressive. If regressivity is part of a proposed tax, it can often become the focus of a political argument against that tax, even if regressivity is a by-product rather than the intention of the tax. Consequently, the chief examples of specific regressive taxes are those on goods whose consumption society wishes to discourage, such as tobacco, gasoline, and alcohol. These are often called “ sin taxes .” Most economists agree that the regressivity or progressivity of any specific tax is of minor economic importance. What matters is the degree of progressivity of the tax system as a whole. This is why even economists who advocate a steeply progressive overall tax system might support a tax on gasoline as a way of reducing air pollution; if the gasoline tax is an efficient way of reducing air pollution, its modest contribution to overall regressivity can be easily offset by more progressive wage or income taxes."", 'Some propose a flat tax rate instead of a progressive tax, or a tax on spending instead of on income. Others favor a regressive tax, where percentage of taxes decreases when income increases. This would mean people who make the most would pay a much lower percentage in taxes, but since their income is high, they’d still pay quite a bit in taxes. People who make the least would pay the highest percentages, though allowances might still be made for those under the poverty level. This system would purportedly mean everyone would pay about the same amount in taxes each year. Critics of the regressive tax system suggest this would be an unfair burden on those least able to afford taxes.

For example, if a city institutes a 5% sale tax on groceries, everyone who buys groceries (that is, everyone) must pay 5% extra. Because the poor and the lower middle class make less money than other classes, the extra 5% is more difficult for them to afford. As a result, regressive taxes are less popular among left-wing political groups. However, proponents argue that regressive taxes are fair, at least to a certain extent, because they do not punish success. Farlex Financial Dictionary. © 2012 Farlex, Inc. All Rights Reserved\nregressive tax\nA tax that has a rate that declines as the amount to be taxed increases. In terms of income, federal and state taxation of cigarettes is regressive because low-income smokers pay a higher rate of taxation in terms of their income than high-income smokers do. A system of regressive taxation tends to free more funds for investment because high-income individuals tend to save a greater portion of their income. However, a regressive tax is often considered socially and politically unacceptable.']";The primary moral argument of critics against a regressive tax system centers on its disproportionate impact on lower-income individuals. Since everyone, regardless of their income, pays the same dollar amount or percentage for certain taxes, those with lower incomes spend a larger proportion of their earnings on these taxes compared to higher-income earners. This perceived unfairness is based on the principle that the tax system imposes an unequal financial burden on those least able to afford it, exacerbating economic inequality.;['Unfair to tax poor more heavily than rich', 'Regressive taxes disproportionately burden the poor', 'Threatens basic needs for low-income individuals', 'Lower income pay higher percentage of income', 'Exacerbates economic inequality', 'It violates the ability-to-pay principle', 'Moral obligation to help those less fortunate'];['Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Okay', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Okay'];['support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.0

Wade\nSarah Weddington General Entry\nRoe v. Wade. A Texas case stands at the center of years of national debate about the issue of abortion. That case, Roe v. Wade, was decided by the United States Supreme Court on January 22, 1973. The ruling basically held that women have a right, under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, to decide whether to continue or to terminate a pregnancy. It overturned a Texas law making all abortions (except those performed to save the life of the woman) illegal, and by implication overturned antiabortion statutes in most other states. The roots of the case lie in Austin, Texas, during the late 1960s. A group of local volunteers were telling women about birth control and how to avoid pregnancy. Their action followed a 1965 Supreme Court case, Griswold v. Connecticut, which overturned state laws making criminal the use of contraception. However, some women who approached them were already pregnant and wanted to know where and how to get an abortion. The volunteers originally wanted to know whether they could legally provide that information, including information about illegal abortion providers in Texas and Mexico, or whether doing so would subject them to possible prosecution as accomplices to the crime of abortion.', ""JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court. This Texas federal appeal and its Georgia companion, Doe v. Bolton, post, p. 179, present constitutional challenges to state criminal abortion legislation. The Texas statutes under attack here are typical of those that have been in effect in many States for approximately a century. The Georgia statutes, in contrast, have a modern cast and are a legislative product that, to an extent at least, obviously reflects the influences of recent attitudinal change, of advancing medical knowledge and techniques, and of new thinking about an old issue. We forthwith acknowledge our awareness of the sensitive and emotional nature of the abortion controversy, of the vigorous opposing views, even among physicians, and of the deep and seemingly absolute convictions that the subject inspires. One's philosophy, one's experiences, one's exposure to the raw edges of human existence, one's religious training, one's attitudes toward life and family and their values, and the moral standards one establishes and seeks to observe, are all likely to influence and to color one's thinking and conclusions about abortion. In addition, population growth, pollution, poverty, and racial overtones tend to complicate and not to simplify the problem. Our task, of course, is to resolve the issue by constitutional measurement, free of emotion and of predilection. We seek earnestly to do this, and, because we do, we [410 U.S. 113, 117] have inquired into, and in this opinion place some emphasis upon, medical and medical-legal history and what that history reveals about man's attitudes toward the abortion procedure over the centuries. We bear in mind, too, Mr. Justice Holmes' admonition in his now-vindicated dissent in Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 76  (1905):"", '1191–94, 1196\nOverruled by\n(partially) Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992)\nRoe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States protects a pregnant woman\'s liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction. It struck down many U.S. federal and state abortion laws, and prompted an ongoing national debate in the United States about whether and to what extent abortion should be legal, who should decide the legality of abortion, what methods the Supreme Court should use in constitutional adjudication, and what the role of religious and moral views in the political sphere should be. Roe v. Wade reshaped American politics, dividing much of the United States into abortion rights and anti-abortion movements, while activating grassroots movements on both sides. The decision involved the case of Norma McCorvey —known in her lawsuit under the pseudonym ""Jane Roe""—who in 1969 became pregnant with her third child. McCorvey wanted an abortion, but she lived in Texas, where abortion was illegal except when necessary to save the mother\'s life. She was referred to lawyers Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee, who filed a lawsuit on her behalf in U.S. federal court against her local district attorney, Henry Wade, alleging that Texas\'s abortion laws were unconstitutional. A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas heard the case and ruled in her favor. Texas then appealed this ruling directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case. In January 1973, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 decision ruling that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides a ""right to privacy"" that protects a pregnant woman\'s right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. But it also ruled that this right is not absolute, and must be balanced against the government\'s interests in protecting women\'s health and protecting prenatal life.', 'The oral arguments and re-arguments followed the same schedule as those in Roe. Atlanta attorney Hames represented Doe at the hearings, while Georgia assistant attorney general Dorothy Toth Beasley represented Bolton. Opinion of the Court\nThe same 7–2 majority that struck down a Texas abortion law in Roe v. Wade invalidated most of the remaining restrictions of the Georgia abortion law, including the medical approval and residency requirements. The Court reiterated the protected "" right to privacy ,"" which applied to matters involving marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education. Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote the majority opinion for the Court, in which he explained ""the sensitive and emotional nature"" of the issue and ""the deep and seemingly absolute convictions"" on both sides. Justice Blackmun went on to conclude that as a constitutional matter, the right to privacy was ""broad enough to encompass a woman\'s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."" Together, Doe and Roe declared abortion as a constitutional right and overturned most laws against abortion in other U.S. states. Roe legalized abortion nationwide for approximately the first six months of pregnancy until the point of fetal viability. Definition of health\nThe Court\'s opinion in Doe v. Bolton stated that a woman may obtain an abortion after viability, if necessary to protect her health. The Court defined ""health"" as follows:', 'by Norma G.

The European powers controlled their territory in Africa in several different ways. Some of these methods involved direct elements of control, while others were indirect. In general, historians have identified three different forms of European rule in Africa, including protectorates, spheres of influence and colonies. Click here to read a more detailed article about the nature of European rule in Africa during the Age of Imperialism.\u200b\n\u200b\nIMPACTS OF IMPERIALISM IN AFRICA\nHistorians have identified both positive and negative impacts from the period of European imperialism in Africa.', 'Following diplomatic negotiations, the dispute was resolved in favor of the British, and Sudan became part of the British Empire. Africa, imperialism, and the partition of the 13th War did break out between the British and Boers over control of South Africa in 1899. By 1902 the British had emerged victorious, and South Africa was added to their empire. In West Africa, European powers carved out long narrow states running north to south so that each would have access to maritime trade routes and a port city. Since most Europeans knew little or nothing about the local geography or demographics of the region, these new states often separated similar ethnic groups or put traditional enemies together under one administration. The difficulties posed by these differences continue to plague present-day West African nations such as Nigeria. French and British Rule\nThe French and British adopted very different approaches to governance in their empires. The French believed in their “civilizing mission” and sought to assimilate the peoples of their empire by implanting French culture and language. The British adopted a policy of “indirect rule.” They made no attempt to assimilate the peoples of their empire and educated only a small number of Africans to become civil servants.', 'So, what was different this time? ‹ ›\nThe short answer is industrialization. As industrialization spread and matured in the 19th century throughout western and central Europe, it gave countries the wealth, technology, and motivation to look beyond their homelands. Nations competed with each other for access to raw materials, markets, and cheap labor. As European industrial production increased and spread, raw materials became harder to come by. A sure way to control raw materials and markets would be to create colonial monopolies. Lenin viewed imperialism as the last stage of industrial exploitation. Industrialization, according to socialists like Lenin, led inevitably to imperialism because the capitalist system was always on the look out to take advantage of the weak and defenseless. As industries in Europe competed, they searched for the cheapest and easiest access to raw materials. Certainly, the dream of gold and silver treasure in Africa existed long before the 19th century.', 'Imperialism in Africa - History Crunch - History Articles, Summaries, Biographies, Resources and More\nIMPERIALISM IN AFRICA\nImperialism in Africa is an important topic in world history. It is related to the Age of Imperialism and the expansion of the European empires in the 19th century. In fact, the European powers of the 19th century competed with one another for territory and control over large sections of the African continent. The ‘scramble’ that occurred for Africa in the Age of Imperialism left a legacy on the people and regions of Africa that stills exists today. In order to understand the significance of Imperialism in Africa, its first important to understand imperialism and the history of Africa before the Age of Imperialism.\u200b\nWHAT IS IMPERIALISM? Imperialism is a term that relates to when one country extends its political, economic or cultural authority over another country or region. This process involves the dominant country taking over the other through direct invasion and political control or by gaining authority over the economy of the other country. Imperialism, in history, was a foreign policy practiced by many different nations but is most often associated with European countries, the United States, and some Asian countries.\u200b\nBritain played one of the most significant roles during the Age of Imperialism. As stated above, many European nations were spreading their influence throughout the world in the 18th and 19th centuries and took over control of vast regions of the world. However, Britain was the most important of these European nations, because the British Empire expanded the most at the time and came to be the largest empire in the world.'];The story of imperialism in Africa was marked by distinctive characteristics due to several events and policies. One unique aspect was the intense competition among European powers at the Berlin Conference and subsequent challenges like the Moroccan Crises, which orchestrated the partitioning of Africa without regard to indigenous boundaries, leading to lasting ethnic and political conflicts. Another distinctive experience was the extreme exploitation and dehumanization, exemplified by events like the brutal rule of Leopold II in the Congo, where exploitation was extraordinarily severe, leading to millions of deaths and immense suffering. This level of exploitation and direct control was less common in other regions affected by European imperialism.;['Scramble for Africa, 1870-1914', 'Berlin Conference 1884-85', 'Arbitrary borders, ethnic conflict', 'Extreme resource exploitation', 'Brutal colonial rule, resistance', 'Unequal power dynamics, economic dependence', 'Competition between European powers', 'African rivalries exploited', 'Rapid colonization speed', 'Cultural imperialism, dis-Africanization', 'Ignoring African interests', 'Loss of African sovereignty', 'Diverse colonial administrations', 'King Leopold II’s brutality', 'Hegemonic racism from slave trade', 'Atlantic Slave Trade’s lasting impact', 'Direct vs. indirect rule', 'Disease, death from European diseases', 'Superior European weaponry', 'Post-colonial challenges, neocolonialism', 'Ethiopia’s unique resistance', 'South Africa’s unique colonization', 'South Africa’s apartheid legacy', 'Diverse resistance movements'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support'];0.6666666666666666

To live in congruence with your beliefs and values means that your lifestyle choices, day-to-day activities, conversation, and thought-life reflect what you hold to be right and important – both in God’s sight and in your own. Being incongruent involves saying, thinking or doing things that make you feel bad or wrong, or which otherwise violate your conscience. Examples of incongruency include having an affair when you believe in marital faithfulness, cheating on your taxes despite saying that you value honesty, gossiping about a friend even though you treasure your relationship, or yelling at your spouse and children despite having been very injured by the same behavior when growing up. Living Incongruently Causes Stress\nAnother way of living incongruently with your values can be seen when your priorities are out of order.

Clarify your values; write a list of what they are, then modify your behavior to work with your values rather than against them. This will get you to your destination faster. For example, if your value is to have more acceptance, but you find yourself judging others on a regular base, then you may need to do cognitive and behavioral modification. Or, if your value is to be a loyal lover, but you are continuously being inappropriate with other people, then you may want to check that. 4.', 'As this happens, relationships with your loved ones, which may already be suffering, are likely to become even more strained over time.

Our Conscience Can Warn Us When We Live Incongruently\nCongruence is closely tied to our conscience, and the Bible speaks about this in various places. Here are some examples of passages that highlight the importance of our conscience. This being so, I myself always strive to have a conscience without offense toward God and men. ( Acts 24:16)\nDear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and receive from Him anything we ask, because we keep His commands and do what pleases Him.

On the other hand, if you’re working in a role that isn’t a good fit with your values, you’ll probably feel disconnected from your job. And, if it’s an extreme mismatch, you could feel miserable, which could trigger depression. Think about this: Let’s say you pursued a career because you knew there were a lot of opportunities for growth within it. You were frequently up for promotions and big bonuses, and your career indeed did take off. So you were very financially successful, but you were never really happy because work took up so much of your time and raising a family was among your most treasured values. Your professional success ended up costing you that valuable time with your family. At this point, you’re lacking your desired feeling of connection with your family, which is the thing that would have fulfilled you the most in life. Your great career, on the other hand, doesn’t bring that same amount of happiness.']";If your financial behaviors don't align with your values, you may experience various negative consequences. Firstly, such misalignment can result in constant rationalizations and excuses which over time become less effective, leading to an erosion of inner peace and self-respect. This inner turmoil can escalate and require suppression through unhealthy habits such as drug use, alcohol consumption, or other addictive behaviors like gambling, shopping, or viewing pornography. Additionally, the discord between your behaviors and values can strain relationships with loved ones, potentially worsening if the incongruence continues.

With a campaign focused on bringing hope to the American people and change to American politics, Barack Obama became the first African American elected president of the United States. A groundswell of popular support for this Democratic candidate had led media and pundits to expect record levels of voter turnout on election day in 2008, but in the end, the turnout mirrored that of the 2004 election cycle. Approximately 131 million Americans, or 64 percent of all registered voters, participated in the presidential election. However, the voting public in 2008 looked significantly different from the voting public in 2004. The candidacy of Barack Obama managed to energize groups of voters who might not have participated otherwise. --Young adults (individuals between 18 and 24 years of age) went to the polls in greater numbers than ever before. --Among these young voters, African Americans showed the greatest boost in turnout—an increase of 8 percent over 2004 election turnout rates. --Overall, the voting rates for ethnic minorities increased by about 4 percent in the 2008 election.

Since the 1996 presidential election, the gap has narrowed steadily, and in 2008, the lines crossed for the first time. Election experts and scholars who have examined this gap over the years have theorized that it stems, at least in part, from a tendency of some Census Bureau survey respondents to report that they had voted even if they had not (Bernstein, Chadha and Montjoy, 2001). Another possible explanation is that in every election, some small portion of ballots are improperly cast and do not become a part of the official count—but the voters who cast such ballots report to the Census Bureau that they had voted. There is no consensus among experts to explain the recent convergence in the number of votes tallied by the states and those reported by the Census Bureau. One possibility is that there has been a decline in spoiled, uncounted ballots in recent elections.

Comparing the Census Bureau’s Turnout Estimate with the Reported Vote Tally\nThe Census Bureau’s biannual Current Population Survey November Voting and Registration Supplement is the most comprehensive data source available for examining the demographic composition of the electorate in federal elections. However, because it relies on post-election self-reporting by survey respondents in some 55,000 households, these weighted CPS estimates of turnout never match up precisely with the actual number of votes tallied in the 50 states. According to the CPS, an estimated 131.1 million U.S. citizens voted in the 2008 presidential election – slightly less than the 131.3 million votes cast for president, as reported by the Center for the Study of the American Electorate ( Gans, 2008) and other sources ( McDonald, 2009 ). This is the first time since the Census Bureau began taking a post-election survey in 1964 that its estimate is smaller than the number of votes tallied by the states. Prior to 2008, the gap had always run in the opposite direction, with variances ranging between a low of 2.8% (in 2004) and a high of 11.6% (in 1988).

There is another layer of complication in becoming the president, getting the endorsement of one of the two major parties (Democratic or Republican). The candidate selected to run for president by the major parties is done through a complex system of caucuses and primaries. A good example of this is the concern during the 2008 election that relatively small states were having a disproportional effect on who was selected as a candidate because these small states had their primaries early compared with larger states. This resulted in the decision of Michigan and Florida to reschedule their primaries to earlier than in the past. However, the Democratic Party decided that it would not allow the delegates elected in these rescheduled primaries to be ""seated"" at the party convention. The issue of how to equalize the influence of people in different parts of the country in the selection of party candidates is a complex one, which scholars in many disciplines are addressing, using mathematical methods.

First, the candidacy of Barack Obama energized new voter demographics, notably young adults and ethnic minorities, suggesting a shift towards a more inclusive political engagement among traditionally underrepresented groups. Second, the fact that total voter turnout mirrored that of the previous election cycle, despite increased participation from specific demographics, may indicate a ceiling in participation rates or offsetting declines in other voter groups. Lastly, the improved consistency between the reported turnout figures from the Census Bureau's survey and actual votes tallied could suggest enhancements in survey accuracy, a reduction in ballot spoilage, or increased involvement from citizens abroad, all of which contribute to a clearer and potentially more accurate reflection of voter engagement. These factors collectively indicate a continuing evolution of electoral participation and methodology, highlighting the dynamic nature of American democracy.;['Highly competitive 2008 election boosted turnout.', 'Obama’s campaign mobilized voters effectively.', 'Grassroots organizations played a significant role.', 'Face-to-face contact increased voter participation.', 'Increased voter registration among Democrats.', 'Demographic shifts influenced voting patterns.', 'Allegations of voter transportation by Democrats.', 'Voter ID laws potentially suppressed turnout.', 'Absentee voting increased, raising security concerns.', 'Polling showed Obama with a consistent lead.', 'McCain tied to unpopular Bush administration.'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.4

That same year, the Velvet Underground song "" All Tomorrow\'s Parties "" created a kind of ""mesmerizing gothic-rock masterpiece"" according to music historian Kurt Loder. In the late 1970s, the gothic adjective was used to describe the atmosphere of post-punk bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees, Magazine, and Joy Division. In a live review about a Siouxsie and the Banshees\' concert in July 1978, critic Nick Kent wrote that, concerning their music, "" [P]arallels and comparisons can now be drawn with gothic rock architects like the Doors and, certainly, early Velvet Underground"". In March 1979, in his review of Magazine\'s second album Secondhand Daylight, Kent noted that there was ""a new austere sense of authority"" in the music, with a ""dank neo-Gothic sound"". Later that year, the term was also used by Joy Division \'s manager, Tony Wilson on 15 September in an interview for the BBC TV programme\'s Something Else. Wilson described Joy Division as ""gothic"" compared to the pop mainstream, right before a live performance of the band. The term was later applied to ""newer bands such as Bauhaus who had arrived in the wake of Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees"".', ""Goths do wear mostly dark clothing and share a general dissatisfaction with society and/or a desire to be different. Music, art and literature are also part of the Goth subculture. Music can include a number of dark, tragic and mysterious sounds, including bands like Bauhaus, Siouxsie & the Banshees, Fields of the Nephilim, and the Sisters of Mercy (however, some also mention a large '80s music following among the Goth community). In a new study, 53 percent of youths in the Goth subculture reported self-harming behaviors, compared to 7-14 percent in the general youth population. Violence, however, is not a part of the traditional Goth scene, with most members describing themselves as pacifistic, open-minded and accepting of everyone. And, modern Goths do not associate with any religion. They are not Satanists, as is commonly thought, but instead encompass a wide range of religions, from Christianity to Buddhism.

By banning books from the classroom, we prevent our students from learning about controversial topics in a safe environment, and we also encroach upon the student’s freedom of reading what they want in…show more content…\nAccording to the American Library Association, the most common group of people, challenging a book being read in schools, was the parents of the students. Parents have a right to be in charge of what is put into the minds of their students, however just because one parent objects does not mean that the whole school should ban the book from the list. A solution for this book would be to enforce parental consent for books to be read in the classroom. If a parent does not want a book to be read in the classroom, then there should be other options for the student to read. The school and teacher should not trespass on a parent’s rights of raising their child. I believe that if a parent has a concern, they should go and discuss the problem with the teacher so that the teacher will be able to defend their reasoning for choosing the book to be read in the classroom.', 'If a controversial book will be read in the classroom, it is the teacher’s responsibility to prepare the student for it. The teacher must ensure that the book is age-appropriate for the student, and is appropriate for the subject matter that the teacher is covering.

There’s a reason why the titles like Brave New World or To Kill a Mockingbird tend to be the ones that instructors choose for their classes repetitively. Instead of constantly challenging these titles by trying to ban them, it might be more useful to have a sit, grab a cocktail, and read the book one one’s own before trying to stop others. 4. Many banned books become celebrated classics of literature. Almost all of the classics that we read in various literature classes say something that the human race needs to hear. Even the Library of Congress has put together lists of titles that have helped to shape our heritage, each one offering something unique with extraordinary merit. These stories are already designed to confront the various issues of their time, including moral, social, and political problems. Trying to ban the book will not prevent the idea from being unleashed on the rest of the culture. If anything, the act of banning a book creates more of an urge in the general public to read the narrative instead of ignoring it.'];"Teachers and school authorities often grapple with the complex issue of banning books. They are tasked with protecting the minds of students and ensuring that content is age-appropriate, yet they must also foster an environment where students can access a broad range of ideas and discussions about world issues. This dynamic creates a balancing act where teachers need to prepare and potentially defend their choices of literature, ensuring they are fit for educational purposes and aligned with the developmental levels of their students. Teachers play a crucial role in mediating between the content of books, such as ""The Catcher in The Rye,"" and the readiness of their students to engage with them, understanding that certain books might require careful discussion due to sensitive topics they address.

The combination of bilateral trade, investment, and supply chain integration has supported economic growth, consumer choice, and job creation. In 2019, exports to China supported 1.2 million jobs in the US and as of 2018, 197,000 people in the US were directly employed by Chinese multinational firms. US companies invested $105 billion in China in 2019, and the profits from these investments and the contribution they make to the competitiveness of US businesses help support the US economy through R&D, domestic investment, and dividend payments. With China forecast to drive around one-third of global growth over the next decade, maintaining market access to China is increasingly essential for US businesses’ global success. The trade war with China hurt the US economy and failed to achieve major policy goals outlined by the Trump administration. Rather than benefiting the economy, it has reduced US economic growth and employment, resulting in an estimated peak loss of 245,000 jobs. Tariff rates remain at a multi-decade high despite both countries reaching a phase one trade agreement in early 2020. While the agreement made important progress on longstanding trade barriers in agriculture, financial services, and intellectual property protection, it failed to address a range of administration concerns over Chinese state-owned enterprise disciplines, distorting subsidies, data and cybersecurity, and other areas of market access. While the trade deficit with China did narrow in 2019, this was offset by an increased trade deficit with the rest of the world, leaving the overall US trade deficit broadly unchanged.', 'According\n \nto\n \nU.S.\n \ntrade\n \ndata,\n \ntotal\n \ntrade\n \nbetween\n \nthe\n \ntwo\n \ncountries\n \ngrew\n \nfrom\n \n$5\n \nbillion\n \nin\n \n1980\n \nto\n \n$660\n \nbillion\n \nin\n \n2018.

Such reforms are needed in order for China to avoid hitting the “middle-income trap,” when countries achieve a certain economic level but begin to experience sharply diminishing economic growth rates because they are unable to adopt new sources of economic growth, such as innovation. The Chinese government has made innovation a top priority in its economic planning through a number of high-profile initiatives, such as “Made in China 2025,” a plan announced in 2015 to upgrade and modernize China’s manufacturing in 10 key sectors through extensive government assistance in order to make China a major global player in these sectors. However, such measures have increasingly raised concerns that China intends to use industrial policies to decrease the country’s reliance on foreign technology (including by locking out foreign firms in China) and eventually dominate global markets. In 2017, the Trump Administration launched a Section 301 investigation of China’s innovation and intellectual property policies deemed harmful to U.S. economic interests. It subsequently raised tariffs by 25% on $250 billion worth of imports from China, while China increased tariffs (ranging from 5% to 25%) on $110 billion worth of imports from the United States. Such measures have sharply decreased bilateral trade in 2019. On May 10, 2019, President Trump announced he was considering raising tariffs on nearly all remaining products from China. A protracted and escalating trade conflict between the United States and China could have negative consequences for the Chinese economy.

When thinking back to films that really impacted the entire decade, nothing comes to mind more quickly than ‘Jurassic Park.’ Steven Spielberg’s 1993 masterpiece was revolutionary for its use of computer-generated effects, which are now used in pretty much all films and TV series out of Hollywood.

The 90's pop culture gave birth to the iconic fashion shows, television shows and sitcoms, different genres of life-changing music, entertaining sporting activities, blockbuster movies, and video games. If you are a millennial, you can surely remember how exciting these times were. Do not worry, if you cannot remember much about the 1990's pop culture. Most of it is slowly coming back, like Nickelodeon, and high fashion events. So, let's walk back into the 1990s and remember how exciting those moments were: 1. The Collectible Toys and Video Games\nComplex and smarter toys became a thing in the 1990s.

WCW vs. WWE – The Monday Night Wars (1995-1999)\nFor the first half of the 1900s, professional wrestling was primarily viewed as an actual sport among most Americans. Well, that was until they discovered the matches were pre-determined and most of the action was composed of fake punches. Since then, the business rightfully took its place as entertainment. In the 1990s, that business really rose to prominence when Ted Turner’s World Championship Wrestling opted to produce a Monday night show called ‘Nitro’ that would go head-to-head with Vince McMahon’s World Wrestling Entertainment and its flagship program, ‘RAW,’ which aired on the same night. The decisions was seen early on as loony by some industry insiders, but would go on to produce the most viewed era in the history of professional wrestling.

After the middle of the decade, a severe economic depression halted industrial expansion and aggravated urban unemployment. At the same time, serious crop failures led to a major famine in the area from Ireland to Russian Poland. In the German states, the hungry 1840s drove the lower classes, which had long been suffering from the economic effects of industrial and agricultural rationalization, to the point of open rebellion. There were sporadic hunger riots and violent disturbances in several of the states, but the signal for a concerted uprising did not come until early in 1848 with the exciting news that the regime of the bourgeois king Louis-Philippe had been overthrown by an insurrection in Paris (February 22–24). The result was a series of sympathetic revolutions against the governments of the German Confederation, most of them mild but a few, as in the case of the fighting in Berlin, bitter and bloody. When on March 13 Metternich, the proud symbol of the established order, was forced to resign his position in the Austrian cabinet, the princes hastened to make peace with the opposition in order to forestall republican and socialist experiments like those in France. Prominent liberals were appointed to the state ministries, and civic reforms were introduced to safeguard the rights of the citizens and the powers of the legislature. But even more important was the attempt to achieve political unification through a national assembly representing all of Germany. Elections were held soon after the spring uprising had subsided, and on May 18 the Frankfurt National Assembly met in Frankfurt am Main to prepare the constitution for a free and united fatherland.', 'Patriotic feelings of the public were effectively captured in the poem Die Wacht am Rhein ( Watch on the Rhine) by Max Schneckenburger, and in songs such as ""Der Deutsche Rhein"" and the "" Lied der Deutschen "", the national anthem of Germany since 1922. The mid-1840s saw an increased frequency of internal crises. This was partially the result of large-scale political developments, such as the escalation of the future of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein and the erection of the Bundesfestungen. Additionally, a series of bad harvests in parts of Germany, notably the southwest, led to widely spread famine-related unrest in 1845 and 1846. The changes caused by the beginnings of industrialisation exacerbated social and economic tensions considerably, especially in Saxony and Silesia . Meanwhile, in the reform-oriented states, such as Baden, the development of a lively scene of Vereine ( clubs or voluntary associations) provided an organizational framework for democratic, or popular, opposition. Especially in south west Germany, censorship could not effectively suppress the press. At such rallies as the Offenburg Popular Assembly of September 1847, radical democrats called to overthrow the status quo. At the same time, the bourgeois (here used to describe the Middle Class) opposition had increased its networking activities and began coordinating its activities in the individual chamber parliaments more and more confidently. Thus, at the Heppenheim Conference on 10 October 1847, eighteen liberal members from a variety of German states met to discuss common motions for a German nation-state.', 'The unrest that resulted from the 1830 French July Revolution led to a temporary reversal of that trend, but after the demonstration for civic rights and national unity at the 1832 Hambach Festival, and the abortive attempt at an armed rising in the 1833 Frankfurter Wachensturm, the pressure on representatives of constitutional or democratic ideas was raised through measures such as censorship and bans on public assemblies. The 1840s\nMain article: Vormärz\nThe 1840s began with the Rhine Crisis, a primarily diplomatic scandal caused by the threat from the French prime minister Adolphe Thiers to invade Germany in a dispute between Paris and the four other Great Powers (including Austria and Prussia) over the Middle East. The threat alarmed the German Confederate Diet ( Bundesversammlung ), which was made up of representatives of the individual princes, and the only institution representing the whole German Confederation. The Diet voted to extend the Fortresses of the German Confederation ( Bundesfestungen) at Mainz, Ulm, and Rastatt, while the Kingdom of Bavaria developed the fortress at Germersheim. Patriotic feelings of the public were effectively captured in the poem Die Wacht am Rhein ( Watch on the Rhine) by Max Schneckenburger, and in songs such as ""Der Deutsche Rhein"" and the "" Lied der Deutschen "", the national anthem of Germany since 1922.

The changes caused by the beginnings of industrialisation exacerbated social and economic tensions considerably, especially in Saxony and Silesia .', 'The situation in the German states was similar. Parts of Prussia were beginning to industrialize. During the decade of the 1840s, mechanized production in the textile industry brought about inexpensive clothing that undercut the handmade products of German tailors. Reforms ameliorated the most unpopular features of rural feudalism, but industrial workers remained dissatisfied with these reforms and pressed for greater change. Urban workers had no choice but to spend half of their income on food, which consisted mostly of bread and potatoes. As a result of harvest failures, food prices soared and the demand for manufactured goods decreased, causing an increase in unemployment. During the revolution, to address the problem of unemployment, workshops were organized for men interested in construction work. Officials also set up workshops for women when they felt they were excluded. Artisans and unemployed workers destroyed industrial machines when they threatened to give employers more power over them. Rural areas\nRural population growth had led to food shortages, land pressure, and migration, both within and from Europe, especially to the Americas.', ""They were a series of loosely coordinated protests and rebellions in the states of the German Confederation, including the Austrian Empire. The revolutions, which stressed pan-Germanism, demonstrated popular discontent with the traditional, largely autocratic political structure of the thirty-nine independent states of the Confederation that inherited the German territory of the former Holy Roman Empire after its dismantlement as a result of the Napoleonic Wars. This process began in the mid 1840s. The middle-class elements were committed to liberal principles, while the working class sought radical improvements to their working and living conditions. As the middle class and working class components of the Revolution split, the conservative aristocracy defeated it. Liberals were forced into exile to escape political persecution, where they became known as Forty-Eighters. Many emigrated to the United States, settling from Wisconsin to Texas.

The Hambacher Fest is also noteworthy for the Republicans adopting the black-red-gold colours used on today's national flag of Germany as a symbol of the Republican movement and of the unity among the German-speaking people. Activism for liberal reforms spread through many of the German states, each of which had distinct revolutions.""]";In Germany during the 1840s, a period of severe economic distress and widespread famine (from bad harvests in 1845 and 1846) led to the 1848 revolution, spurred on by unemployment and industrial tensions exacerbated by the early phases of industrialization. This revolution was part of a broader wave of uprisings across Europe and featured demands from various social classes seeking liberal and radical improvements in their living and working conditions. The Frankfurt National Assembly, convened in May 1848, was a significant moment in this period, aiming to draft a constitution for a unified Germany, reflecting the widespread nationalist and liberal sentiments of the time. Meanwhile, in the Netherlands during this same period, the decade was marked primarily by socio-political stability under the rule of King William II. Unlike the turbulent neighboring German states, the Netherlands did not experience the same level of revolutionary activity. However, economic influences from the wider European context did impact Dutch society, although not to the extent or intensity that led to revolutions like those in Germany.

The further development of Pan-Africanism was associated with the activization of forces opposing colonial oppression in Africa. The first four Pan-African congresses, in which W. E. B. Du Bois participated, were held in 1919 (Paris), 1921 (London, Brussels, and Paris), 1923 (London and Lisbon), and 1927 (New York). They were marked by a sharp ideological struggle between partisans of a radical orientation, who demanded the liberation of the African peoples from colonial oppression, and conservative elements, who were opposed only to the most glaring manifestations of colonial exploitation in Africa and racial discrimination in the USA.

When a machine amassed great power - as it did in New York City, it would often have a well-known boss.', 'Although cities such as Philadelphia, Boston, and New York sprang up from the initial days of colonial settlement, the explosion in urban population growth did not occur until the mid-nineteenth century ( Figure ). At this time, the attractions of city life, and in particular, employment opportunities, grew exponentially due to rapid changes in industrialization. Before the mid-1800s, factories, such as the early textile mills, had to be located near rivers and seaports, both for the transport of goods and the necessary water power. Production became dependent upon seasonal water flow, with cold, icy winters all but stopping river transportation entirely. The development of the steam engine transformed this need, allowing businesses to locate their factories near urban centers. These factories encouraged more and more people to move to urban areas where jobs were plentiful, but hourly wages were often low and the work was routine and grindingly monotonous. As these panels illustrate, the population of the United States grew rapidly in the late 1800s (a). Much of this new growth took place in urban areas (defined by the census as twenty-five hundred people or more), and this urban population, particularly that of major cities (b), dealt with challenges and opportunities that were unknown in previous generations. Eventually, cities developed their own unique characters based on the core industry that spurred their growth. In Pittsburgh, it was steel;', 'By 1890, there were 58 cities that size with nearly 12 million people. Most were in the Northeast and near the Great Lakes. The vast majority of cities grew with only minimal, if any planning. Most choices about land use and construction were made by individual landowners, developers, and builders who wanted to make large profits. Thus, everyone buildt the most working and li\\ving space for the least cost - leaving little room for pleasant or open space. Consequences of Rapid Urbanization\nOn the positive side, urbanization brought new jobs, new opportunities, new housing, and new transportation; but on the negative side, urbanization gave rise to widespread urban poverty, sub-standard housing, environmental degradation, increasing crime and violence, violent clashes between labor and management, and political corruption. Housing problems… Urbanization in the late 1800s was especially bad in New York City. Crime: crimes against persons, crimes against property, crimes agains societal morality\nEnvironmental degradation\nPolitical corruption, patronage, and the ""well-greased"" political machine\nThe Democratic Party bribed the state legislature to pass laws that increased the power of the city to tax, borrow, and spend.', 'Urbanization is the growth of cities.

Firstly, it could lead to a situation where approximately five in six unemployment recipients receive more money from benefits than they would by working, potentially discouraging them from seeking employment. On the other hand, proponents argue that these increased benefits could boost the economy by providing unemployed individuals with more disposable income to spend. However, there's also a negative side effect where the increased income from unemployment benefits could make some individuals ineligible for other aid programs like welfare, food stamps, and Medicaid due to means testing which considers unemployment benefits as income.;['Provides crucial financial support to the unemployed.', 'Increased consumer spending boosts economic growth.', 'May disincentivize job searching if benefits are too high.', 'Higher government spending leads to increased budget deficits.', 'Could delay economic recovery if benefits are too generous.', 'Requires careful design to balance support and work incentives.', 'Could lead to higher inflation if spending surges.', 'Reduces poverty and improves living standards for recipients.', 'Allows unemployed to search for better-suited jobs.', 'Impacts vary significantly across industries and regions.', 'May exacerbate existing income inequality.', 'Could have a significant multiplier effect on the economy.', 'Increased risk of unemployment benefits fraud.', 'Extending benefits may increase average unemployment duration slightly.', 'Prevents severe hardship for millions.', 'Aids broader economy.', 'Could create a disincentive to work.', 'Concerns about increased federal debt.', 'Business groups worry about disincentive to return to work.', 'Federal benefits supplement state benefits.', 'Lower-income households and women disproportionately affected.', 'Significant portion of job losses are permanent.', 'Expands eligibility to gig workers and freelancers.', 'Average state unemployment benefit is $378 per week.', 'Supplemental $600 weekly benefit (recent example).', 'Extension to March 14, 2021 (recent example).', 'States with improved unemployment rates may end extended benefits (recent example).', 'Some states offer bonuses for returning to work (recent example).', 'Debate on extension ongoing (recent example).', 'Bipartisan support, but disagreements on duration and funding (recent example).'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.5555555555555556

How to Develop Mentally Agile and Resilient Leaders\nWho Make Sound Decisions\nIn the rest of this article we describe ways leaders can adjust how they train, mentor, assess, and rate their junior leaders. Leaders can ensure the people with the right attributes are available for promotion by training them and then mentoring their most well-rounded leaders so they want to stay in the military. The recent updates to the evaluation reports attempt to steer raters to address these attributes specifically, but these are far from transformative: More individual training for leaders, not just young members. Develop training events for small unit leaders where the service members must constructively deal with media attention, non-governmental organization workers, and local level leaders to test and develop skills of collaboration and dealing with fluid situations. Develop programs of instruction to guide them until they can improvise. Create training that include aspects of the joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational at every level of leadership from the small unit level to our senior leaders. Every training event should have opposing forces, but also a media element that must be managed and briefed on current operations with and without the use of a public affairs officer. More social media training and usage.', 'This, along with the 8-step training model, will demonstrate that units have effectively planned the training and maximized leader development opportunities throughout. Every training event in the BCT has leadership development opportunities – units must capitalize on them wherever possible. Additionally, the guidance defined Brigade-level programs that we conducted throughout the year, to include The Company Commander’s LPD Series, senior-rater counseling sessions, and professional reading programs. The Annual Training Guidance solidified these events through inclusion into our organization’s battle rhythm. Another example is Quarterly Training Guidance, where the organization translates priorities into tangible actions over the subsequent 12 weeks. While Annual Training Guidance is broad in nature, quarterly guidance provided subordinate units a more detailed understanding of objectives, specified tasks, and quarterly endstates. In the context of professional development, this is where the rubber meets the road. Successful organizations operationalize previously provided focus areas by assigning topics to sessions and assuming responsibility for content and administrative support. Effective programs are then paired up with other training activities and corresponding focus areas. As an example, our Brigade rehashed live fire fundamentals, created group live fire plans, conducted a terrain walk, and then fought in simulation.', 'We must develop our junior Soldiers and officers in a manner that will position them and our military for success now and in the future. Army Regulation 600-100: Army Profession and Leadership Policy defines leader development as the deliberate, continuous, sequential, and progressive process, grounded in Army Values, that grows Soldiers and civilians in to competent and confident leaders capable of decisive action. As a leader of Soldiers, it will not only be a part of your daily functions to take care of your Soldiers and their well-being, but you will also have to ensure you are preparing your Soldiers for that day when they become leaders. There are some that will say leaders are born with all the attributes needed to be successful. I would agree some are born with the ability to lead but it is through training and experience that they become effective leaders. It will be your job to ensure the Soldiers you are developing into leaders are given the chance to excel at every cost. You have to share your successes as well as your failures with them so that they can learn from your experiences. You must encourage your Soldiers to increase their knowledge by attending military institutional training as well as civilian education to help them develop.

Ferraro and Eva Van Leemput *\n1. Introduction\nSince the beginning of 2018, the United States and China have increased tariff rates on each other's imports, contributing to fears of a global downturn. In the near-to-medium term, there are several channels through which increased tariffs and continued uncertainty could affect global growth. First, higher tariffs are equivalent to a tax increase, with negative effects on consumption and investment. Second, given China's important role in global value chains, an increase in bilateral tariffs could disrupt supply chains, with significant negative effects on output. Third, increased uncertainty could dampen GDP if firms delay investment and hiring. Finally, the same forces could negatively affect sentiment and roil international financial markets. Outside of these immediate though eventually temporary effects, a persistent increase in tariffs would likely negatively affect the long-run productive capacity of the economy. Higher tariffs could slow the accumulation of capital, shift resources into less productive sectors, reduce the extent of competition, or interfere with the dissemination of technological advances. In this note, we employ a particular model of trade policy effects following Caliendo and Parro (2015) that focuses on the role of tariffs in spurring adverse resource reallocations."", 'This is because most tariffed products can’t easily be replaced, so they will continue to be purchased and this time at higher prices. Hence, if no deal is reached by March 2, Trump has said he will proceed with raising tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, at a time when China’s economy is slowing significantly. On the other hand, Beijing has retaliated in turn to U.S. tariffs. When a tariff is applied to a particular good, here’s what can happen: Low Profitability\nDue to the trade war, it is certain that in some industries, companies will be reluctant or unable to pass the cost onto their customers. Therefore, this implies reduced profits for the company. At the same time, for public companies, earnings will be affected and therefore could also impact stock prices. Let’s take for example Alcoa, the largest producer of aluminium in the US. At first glance, anyone would assume that Alcoa would benefit from tariffs on foreign producers of aluminium; but it’s not that simple.', 'Response to Proposed Tariffs\nTrade actions against China have been cause for concern among many industry groups – outside of the technology sector – for which China has become a critical manufacturing base and/or integral link in their international supply chains. These include apparel, consumer packaged goods, agriculture and several others. The application of the tariff would force businesses in these industries to dramatically increase the landed costs associated with their import practices, forcing them to raise their prices or become less competitive in the international market. China’s retaliation has been equal cause for concern, particularly in the U.S. transportation and agricultural industries, which rely heavily on exports to China. Economic Impact\nWhile views vary on the degree to which these trade barriers will impact the U.S. economy, many economists argue the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. and/or by China will only serve to destabilize the economy and cause speculation in financial markets. Few believe tariffs will effect change with respect to China’s intellectual property practices and will only serve to drive up costs for businesses on both sides and disrupt the global supply chains on which American multinational businesses rely to remain competitive in international markets. The initial list of $34 billion in tariffs will primarily affect finished metal goods, machinery, electrical equipment and industrial goods. The subsequent list – should it resemble the balance of the initial list of 1,300 products announced by the USTR – will affect medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, agriculture and agricultural machinery and textiles, among others.

Dynamism in the global economy is being weighed down by prolonged policy uncertainty as trade tensions remain heightened despite the recent U.S.-China trade truce, technology tensions have erupted threatening global technology supply chains, and the prospects of a no-deal Brexit have increased, she said. Gopinath said a major downside risk to the outlook remains an escalation of trade and technology tensions that can significantly disrupt global supply chains. The combined effect of tariffs imposed last year and potential tariffs envisaged in May between the U.S. and China could reduce the level of global gross domestic product in 2020 by 0.5 percent, she said. With global growth subdued and downside risks dominating the outlook, the global economy remains at a delicate juncture, she said. It is therefore essential that tariffs are not used to target bilateral trade balances or as a general-purpose tool to tackle international disagreements, Gopinath said. ""To help resolve conflicts, the rules-based multilateral trading system should be strengthened and modernised to encompass areas such as digital services, subsidies and technology transfer,"" IMF\'s chief economist added.

However, the United States has started trade disputes with several different economies in order to achieve what it believes to be fair trade. The most intense one is its conflict with China, resulting in a series of additional tariffs. People are assuming that because America is the net buyer and China is the net seller in their trade relationship, China will lose the trade war and ultimately surrender. The truth is that tariffs will hurt both countries. This is because most tariffed products can’t easily be replaced, so they will continue to be purchased and this time at higher prices. Hence, if no deal is reached by March 2, Trump has said he will proceed with raising tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, at a time when China’s economy is slowing significantly.

This containment policy was effective in preventing the spread of communism.

The reason for the United States invading Vietnam was the fear of communism that seemed to be spreading throughout the world. Vietnam, because of the Geneva Convention was divided into two regions; the North and the South, in which the North was under communist rule. Many believe that the United States Foreign Policy was correct in showing its global importance but many others believe that it was one of the greatest and biggest mistakes in history.

In the case of the United States, the policy of containment was used to\neliminate the diplomatic and political policies that were in favor of the communist practices. The Doctrine of Containment was adopted by the United States in order to keep those forms of government from spreading to non-communist countries. The article, “The Sources of Soviet Conduct”, by George Kennan suggests that the Soviet Union be “contained” and its system would ultimately collapse by the nature of its own inefficiencies.

The first of these actions the two sides were involved in took place directly after World War 1. The USSR cut off supplies to the western controlled West Berlin, causing the western nations to jointly organize an international airlift, highlighting the early formation of USSR-US backed blocks. These blocks would be paramount in the formation of close US allies with whom the US could aid and trust to support their foreign policy. Over the course of the airlift, 8,893 tons of necessities were delivered daily by the combined Air Forces of the western block, making it the greatest airlift of all time and proving the strength of the US and its allies (Donnelly, 1965, page. 19).', 'The Soviet Union had told the government of Syria about a prepared attack from Israel.

When the telephone was first introduced in Sweden, many rural folks feared it was magical and that telephone wires would attract lightning or evil spirits. Preachers outright decried the telephone as an instrument of the Devil, and lines were often pulled down or sabotaged by irate farmers.

New forms of communication were perceived as a threat to face-to-face communication, which enforced the social order. One Mennonite reported an elder gravely warning, “There goes the devil’s wires .” Ethiopian journalist Paulos Gno Gno wrote about the introduction of the telephone at the court of the Emperor Menelik: The first telephone was installed in Menelik’s palace in 1889 and the news of the displeasure among many clergymen who resented the new technology finally reached the Emperor’s ears.', 'Telephone History\n1877-1900\nThe Wisconsin Mosaic: Information Infrastructure\n   \nHome\nTelephone\nThe Telephone in Wisconsin\n   \n1877-1900\n   \nThe telephone today is a ubiquitous or even obsolete tool of\ncommunication and information exchange.

Neither\nthe postal system nor the telegraph could provide large-scale, everyday\ninformation as people created it, and deliver it immediately to someone\nelse. The power of the telephone can be seen in its immediate spread\nacross the country. AlexanderGraham Bell invented the\ntelephone in 1876. He made his first call in March to Thomas A. Watson,\nsaying, ""Mr. Watson, come here; I want you."" Few people considered\nBell\'s invention more than a toy, but it did not take long for people to\ninstall telephones in their homes, businesses, or towns. Bell owned the\npatents to the equipment and leased them out.', 'Alexander Graham Bell reluctantly presented his new device at America\'s Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. He didn\'t believe the world would be interested in his invention until he witnessed the startled and astonished reactions of the Exposition scientists and judges, one of whom declared Bell\'s invention the most amazing thing he had seen in America. Within a year of the centennial exhibition, Bell had installed 230 phones and had established the Bell Telephone Company. Four years after its creation, there were 60,000 phones; by the turn of the century there were two million. Despite its novelty and its rudimentary audio quality, the telephone took a quick and fierce hold on American society, and soon became a necessity. The first telephone operators were boys, who soon earned a reputation for being rude and abusive to each other as well as to the customers. The young women who replaced them did not swear and were said to be faster, and by 1910, New York Telephone had 6,000 women working on its switchboards. While the telephone joined teaching in finally bringing significant numbers of women into the workplace, there were rigid codes of dress and conduct the women had to follow. "" You could only use certain phrases — \'Number please\' and \'Thank you,\'"" recalls a former operator, 98-year-old Marie McGrath. ""', 'A few trial and errors later, and the modern telephone was born. Given our reliance on telephones today, it is surprising to know that Bell’s invention was initially quite unpopular. The telephone did not generate nearly as much excitement as the telegraph had a few decades earlier. This may have been due to the fact that Americans love novelty, and Bell’s concept was not entirely new. The telegraph had cornered the long-distance contact market. The lack of popularity may also be attributed to the cost of telephone service. Most original telephone service subscribers were corporations as a year of service cost $72. Residential service cost a family approximately $60 per year. In the 1800’s, this was a substantial sum of money to be spent on an unnecessary device. Bell’s Telephone:', 'Telephone\nToday we take the ability to use a telephone for granted, but in 1876, Alexander Bell was busy realizing a dream that he hoped would once again revolutionize communication. Like all inventors, Bell was perpetually curious and always on the lookout for empirical evidence of the new and interesting. Bell observed that sound vibrations could be transmitted through the air, and received at the same pitch in another room. Bell wanted to transfer sound and pitch across a wire, and ascertained that this would be possible by reproducing sound waves in a continuous, undulating current. Once proving this theory, Bell realized the same concept could be applied to human speech as it is composed of many complex sound vibrations.

Cultural reactions varied significantly: some viewed the device as magical or even diabolical, associating it with evil spirits or the devil, as seen in the fear of rural Swedish communities and criticisms from various religious groups. Additionally, practical acceptance in the U.S. was slow, as many people initially regarded Alexander Graham Bell's telephone as a mere novelty rather than a revolutionary communication tool, influenced by its high cost and the existing popularity of the telegraph.;"['Initial skepticism towards the telephone', 'Early calls were weak and indistinct', 'Improved technology boosted adoption', 'Rapid adoption after initial doubts', 'Telephone exchanges crucial for growth', 'Revolutionized communication', 'Enabled long-distance communication', 'First call: ""Mr. Watson...""', 'Initially seen as a luxury, then a necessity', 'High cost limited early access', 'Early business adoption key', 'Significant social impact', 'Increased productivity and news distribution', 'Bell’s vision: universal voice communication']";['vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital'];['support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'not_support'];0.2222222222222222

The RFRA prohibited the national government from substantially burdening individuals exercising their religious beliefs. The RFRA stipulated that the government can only burden one’s religious exercise if the government’s actions meet two requirements. First, the government’s actions must advance a compelling government interest. Specially, the US government has an obligation to promote the general interest of its citizens.

Before early 1900s, the American Dream also widely used to describe the promotion of people\'s social classes and the idea of becoming wealthy (Kiger, The Origin).

The promise of freedom and a better life drew hopeful immigrants before there was even a country to call home, and has continued to draw countless millions ever since. In the 1900s, the backgrounds of people dreaming the dream had never been broader. The economic ups and downs of a century had never been sharper. The scope of international interest and impact had never been wider. As the modern age arrived and cynicism began to rival idealism in the national mindset, the dark lining of the American dream loomed large in twentieth-century literature. Small-Town Life\nJust after the beginning of the twentieth century, one widely accepted literary vision of the American dream involved life in a small, tightly knit community where residents were free from secrets and ill will. This idealized vision of a perfect American town, far removed from the tumult of the rest of the world, became a symbol for how the United States viewed itself in the larger community of the world. The reality of American small-town life may not have matched this vision very closely, but it was not until just prior to World War I that American writers began to explore this discrepancy in a meaningful way. Edgar Lee Masters, in his poetry collection Spoon River Anthology (1915), employs an ingenious technique for stripping away the rigid customs and traditions of American small-town life:', 'For every American, including the working class, there was ""possibility."" Anything was possible in America. This was the place of the self-made man, the American Dream, ""rags to riches."" Economy and Technology\nWith this prosperity and possibility came jobs. Still largely a rural society, Americans increasingly moved to the city looking for work, armed with a belief in the possibilities and a strong work ethic. Alongside them came nearly a half-million immigrants in 1900, also seeking a better life. America\'s Industrial Revolution produced much prosperity and leisure, but also much poverty and disillusionment. Tycoons such as J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie amassed fortunes greater than many European nobility. But in the same cities, factory workers and coal miners, often children, slaved for perhaps $1 to $2 each 12-16 hour day. With no safety net, many workers just couldn\'t make it -- nearly a third of 1900\'s immigrants headed back home.', 'Work hard, live by the rules, and you will achieve the new American Dream. By the early 20th century, as Americans struggled with the consequences of industrialism and urbanization, there emerged the third phase of the Dream: The Roosevelt phase. The new urban and industrial America presented new challenges that could not be overcome by individual initiative. Cities were filthy and congested. Poor working conditions, long hours, and low wages often defined the urban workplace. Beginning at the turn of the century, progressive reforms on the local, state, and, eventually, the federal level, pushed for new regulations to provide for safe water and food, limit child labor, regulate hours, and improve work conditions. Teddy Roosevelt first articulated this new view of the American Dream during his unsuccessful 1912 campaign for the presidency. He claimed that the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of big business required the federal government to assume the responsibility to guarantee the promise of “life, liberty and happiness.” While T.R. offered rhetorical support to the new view of the Dream, it was his cousin Franklin who institutionalized it as a part of American life.']";Yes, the concept of the American Dream did exist in the early 1900s. During this time, it was broadly associated with the idea of achieving prosperity, with the opportunity for upward social mobility and financial success being central to its appeal. This was particularly true during the Industrial Revolution when the United States experienced significant economic growth and urbanization, drawing both domestic migrants and international immigrants aspiring for a better life, consistent with the ideals of the American Dream.;"['The American Dream was a powerful cultural ideal in the early 1900s.', 'It promised upward mobility and success through hard work.', 'Reality varied widely by race, class, and geographic location.', 'Many faced poverty, inequality, and limited opportunities.', 'Industrialization fueled ""rags-to-riches"" myths, but also exploitation.', 'Immigrants sought escape from hardship, hoping for a better future.', 'The dream was both aspirational and deeply flawed.', 'Racial discrimination severely limited opportunities for many.', 'Economic growth coexisted with widespread poverty and inequality.', 'Access to upward mobility was not guaranteed, especially for minorities.', 'Consumerism shaped the evolving dream, impacting all classes.', 'Westward expansion offered land, but opportunities were limited.', 'Urbanization led to overcrowding and unsafe working conditions.', 'The dream was often realized for future generations, not immediately.', 'It was rooted in ideals of liberty, equality, and the pursuit of happiness.', 'Early 1900s saw economic prosperity, but unevenly distributed.', 'Increased per capita income and factory growth.', 'High population growth and significant capital investment.', 'Gold standard adoption impacted prices and money circulation.', 'Farmers also experienced prosperity during this period.', 'The term ""American Dream"" was not widely used until the 1930s.']";['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.36363636363636365

This transition occurred relatively smoothly due to a strong inclination to work in agriculture which had always been an occupation that had been looked upon with respect in Japan. Progress was made by the Issei in agriculture despite struggles faced cultivating the land, including harsh environment problems such as harsh weather and persistent issues with grass-hoppers.

According to sources, by 1941 Japanese Americans ‘were producing between thirty and thirty-five per cent by value of all commercial truck crops grown in California as well as occupying a dominant position in the distribution system of fruits and vegetables.’ The role of Issei in agriculture prospered in the early twentieth century. It was only in the event of the Internment of Japanese Americans in 1942 that many lost their agricultural businesses and farms.', 'In the 1960\'s, in America the Japanese ranked first among all racial minorities in education, and they have continued to exhibit high achievement in school (Ueda, 1974). A study (Bachu, 1991, cited in Stewart, 1993) has suggested that Japanese immigrants (42.3%) are more likely to hold a highschool diploma than native Americans (39.9%). The study (Bachu, 1991) has also shown that 30.5% of Japanese immigrants have a university degree, as compared with 19.3% American born people who hold it. 42.8% of Chinese immigrants are university graduates. Lynn\' s work (1988) has shown the international comparison. Japanese children in the United States have achieved the highest average mark on tests of science and mathematics (see the tables 1 & 2 in the appendix). "" The average Japanese 12-year-old is approximately at the same academic level as the average 15-year-old in the West"" (Lynn,1988, p.11). EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT OF CHINESE AND JAPANESE IMMIGRANTS AND U.S. CITIZENS OF ASIAN DESCENT\nThe following figures suggest that educational achievement by American-born Asians is lower than that of young people from the same ethnic groups who are sent to the United States to study. Obviously, those ethnic immigrants are involved in their own home culture much more than those who were born in the United States, because of the difference of the process of their socialization. In this respect, it could be assumed that their home cultural background may play an important role in producing their high achievement in education.', 'It was only in 1952 that the Senate and House voted the McCarran-Walter Act which allowed Japanese immigrants to become naturalized U.S. citizens. But significant Japanese immigration did not occur again until the Immigration Act of 1965 which ended 40 years of bans against immigration from Japan and other countries. Farming\nJapanese American farmer in Mountain View, California. Japanese-Americans have made significant contributions to agricultural development in Western-Pacific parts of the United States. Similar to European American settlers, the Issei, the majority of whom were young adult males, immigrated to America searching for better economic conditions and the majority settled in Western Pacific states settling for manual labour jobs in various industries such as ‘railroad, cannery and logging camp labourers. The Japanese workforce were diligent and extremely hardworking, inspired to earn enough money to return and retire in Japan. Consequently, this collective ambition enabled the Issei to work in agriculture as tenant farmers fairly promptly and by ‘1909 approximately 30,000 Japanese labourers worked in the Californian agriculture’. This transition occurred relatively smoothly due to a strong inclination to work in agriculture which had always been an occupation that had been looked upon with respect in Japan. Progress was made by the Issei in agriculture despite struggles faced cultivating the land, including harsh environment problems such as harsh weather and persistent issues with grass-hoppers. Economic difficulties and discriminating socio-political pressures such as the anti-alien laws (see California Alien Land Law of 1913) were further obstacles.', 'Japanese workers proved that they could earn twice the pay of others because they were quick and efficient. They came from a small country with limited farm resources, so they were accustomed to getting the most produce from the lowest-quality farmland. In California, where the land was fertile and abundant, Japanese farmers could outproduce other farmers with techniques such as growing strawberries between rows of grapevines. They were also good at saving their earnings, so eventually farmworkers could combine their individual savings and buy land for the benefit of one another. Immigration from Japan, 1860-2008\nSource: Department of Homeland Security, Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, 2008. Figures include only immigrants who obtained legal permanent resident status. Pressure Builds to Exclude Japanese\nThe Japanese immigrants’ willingness to work long hours and work together in order to purchase farmland made them one of the most successful ethnic groups, but some Americans resented their success. Some people felt that the Japanese were taking away jobs from white Americans. Labor unions such as the American Federation of Labor (AFL) refused to allow Japanese workers to join their organizations.', 'Several served in the segregated 442nd Regimental Combat Team and its predecessor, the 100th Infantry Battalion. Making up over one-third of the population of Hawaii, Japanese Americans were among the first to enlist. They were also the first res-ponders to aid the injured after the attack on Pearl Harbor. These Americans were proud and became some of the most decorated solders in history. They could have used the excuse that their people suddenly had been imprisoned in camps, and their families had lost everything, money, homes and businesses due to the crazy response of the US government after Pearl Harbor. But they didn’t let any system tell them not to do their best because they were of Japanese ethnicity. They succeeded under huge oppression, but succeed they did. Many different immigrants have come to America fleeing countries that wanted to hold them down, control them and what they could own, some wanted to exterminate them altogether. They didn’t show up here saying… Oh we are so tired and weak we can’t do anything. No, they signed up for schools offered for free in America for both males and females.']";Yes, Japanese immigrants in America did achieve significant success despite facing numerous hardships. Initially, many Japanese came with the intention to work hard, save money, and eventually return to Japan, but they quickly adapted to their new environment. They became proficient in agriculture, leveraging their sophisticated agricultural knowledge and traditional respect for hard work to establish and progress in farming despite challenges such as harsh environmental conditions and discriminatory laws like the California Alien Land Law of 1913. Furthermore, Japanese Americans demonstrated remarkable educational achievements, with statistics showing higher rates of high school diplomas and university degrees among Japanese immigrants compared to native-born Americans. This progression underscores their ability to overcome adversity and thrive in various aspects of American society.;['Post-war economic success and global influence.', 'High educational achievement and economic success.', 'Success in business, labor, and politics.', '442nd Regimental Combat Team’s distinguished WWII service.', 'Resilience and perseverance despite internment camps.', 'Established thriving communities and cultural preservation.', 'Overcoming prejudice and anti-Japanese sentiment.', 'Significant contributions to US agriculture.', 'Hawaii’s deep-rooted presence and influence.', 'Internment camp experiences and lasting effects.', 'Loss of businesses and property during internment.', 'Japanese American contributions to WWII.', 'Pre-war agricultural success despite discriminatory laws.', 'Economic hardship and discrimination faced.', 'Gentlemen’s Agreement impact on immigration.'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay'];['not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support'];0.3

Wordsworth’s major legacy was the introduction of a new attitude towards nature as he introduced nature imagery into his work, and presented a fresh view of the relationship between man and the natural world. As a poet, Wordsworth delved deeply into his own sensibilities as he traced the growth of a poet’s mind in his autobiographical poem ‘The Prelude’. Wordsworth not only created some of the finest poetry of his times, but he also placed poetry at the center of human existence, pronouncing it to be “as immortal as the heart of man.” Trivia\n‘The Prelude’, was intended by the poet to be an introduction to a long philosophical poem, ‘The Recluse’, which he never finished in his life time. In 1792, he met John ""Walking"" Stewart, an English traveler and philosopher who had a major influence on his poetry. He and his friends Coleridge and Robert Southey came to be known as the ""Lake Poets"". He succeeded Southey as Britain’s poet laureate in 1843 and held that post until his death in 1850.', ""Though Wordsworth continued to produce poetry — including moving work that mourned the deaths of two of his children in 1812 — he had reached a zenith of creativity between 1798 and 1808. It was this early work that cemented his reputation as an acclaimed literary figure. Death\nIn 1843, Wordsworth became England's poet laureate, a position he held for the rest of his life. At the age of 80, he died on April 23, 1850, at his home in Rydal Mount, Westmorland, England. Fact Check\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.

Rydal Mount in Ambleside, Cumbria – Wordsworth’s home from 1813 to 1850\n#10 His masterpiece The Prelude was published three months after his death\nWilliam Wordsworth died on 23rd April 1850 at his home Rydal Mount from an aggravated case of pleurisy. He was 80 years old. Wordsworth’s autobiographical poem, containing extremely personal details of his life and on which he worked since 1798, The Prelude, was published three months after his death. The Prelude is widely regarded by critics as Wordsworth’s greatest work though his most popular poem is perhaps ‘I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud’, commonly known as Daffodils. William Wordsworth was the central figure in the English Romantic revolution in poetry and is considered one of the greatest poets in English literature. Gravestone of William Wordsworth in Grasmere, Cumbria\nWordsworth and Walking Stewart\nIn 1792, while he was in revolutionary Paris, Wordsworth became acquainted with the famous English traveller and philosopher John Stewart, popularly known as ‘Walking’ Stewart. He is said to have travelled on foot alone from India through Persia, Abyssinia, Arabia and Africa, and every European country as far east as Russia.', 'He wrote extensively about the natural beauty of the Lake District in England. Inspired by Wordsworth’s pastoral descriptions, people from London, which was a dirty, congested city at the time, flocked to the country. Wordsworth’s poems inspired future naturalists, such as John Muir. Some say Wordsworth is credited for inspiring the idea of a national parks movement. Questions and Answers\nQuestion: Did Wordsworth have a happy life? Answer: Wordsworth experienced sadness over the loss of his parents, separation from his siblings, and the deaths of three of his children. However, walking and writing poetry seem to have given him peace and purpose. Many of the poets of his time suffered from mental illness or addiction to opium and alcohol.']";"William Wordsworth's death on April 23, 1850, indeed impacted his contemporaries and followers, as indicated by the publication and reception of his major work posthumously. His autobiographical poem ""The Prelude,"" published three months after his passing, was highly regarded by critics and is considered his greatest work, underscoring his profound influence on English literature and the Romantic poetry movement.

According to Melissa Farley, executive director of Prostitution Research & Education, 60% of clients wear condoms.

Roughly 70% have completed university or college and earn over 50,000 Canadian dollars a year.', 'Technological advances, in particular the Internet and mobile devices, have facilitated the sex trafficking of children by providing a convenient worldwide marketing channel. Individuals can now use websites and social media to advertise, schedule, and purchase sexual encounters with minors. The Internet and mobile devices also allow pimps and traffickers to reach a larger clientele base than in the past, which may expose victims to greater risks and dangers. Child sex trafficking investigations present unique challenges to law enforcement and require a robust multijurisdictional response, with multiple agencies playing a critical role in ensuring the protection of victims and effective prosecution of offenders. The method by which most traffickers identify, recruit, market, and maintain their victims results in a unique combination of sustained violent criminal behavior with reluctant victims and witnesses. Although interviews of sex trafficking victims frequently identify traffickers and other accomplices, some child victims may resist identifying their traffickers because of fear or other means of manipulation that the pimp has exercised over them. Furthermore, the victim may only know their traffickers’ street name and cannot fully identify their traffickers. Child sex trafficking victims are often not recognized as victims and may be arrested and jailed. The dangers faced by these children—from the traffickers, their associates, and from customers—are severe. These children become hardened by the treacherous environment in which they must learn to survive.', ""When the clientele of prostitutes in a specific locality begins to attract modest amounts of newcomers of a middle-class or upper-class status, the subsequent cost hike is known to reduce the use of such services by less affluent local prospective clients. In jurisdictions where penalties for buying sex are high, fines imposed on clients can also put low-income clients of prostitution in financial ruin. Maltreatment and victimization\nWhen interaction between the clients of prostitutes and sex workers occurs in countries where brothels are illegal, the prostitution trade usually transpires in areas with high amounts of crime, a predicament that puts clients at risk of becoming victims of crime, or becoming entangled in the crime in some other manner.

In Ireland, there was a significant increase in physical attacks on sex workers by clients after the passing of laws banning the purchase of sex. Clients also sometimes fall victim to extortion, scamming and blackmail. Perceptions\nThe manner in which clients were viewed has varied throughout human history depending on location and era. in some periods of history, clients were viewed as enablers of an evil practice, viewing them as furthering a trade which enabled infidelity and easing the breaking of covenants between committed partners. At other times, particularly during times of war, or other events which segregated the sexes, there would be increased sympathy for clients, particularly if service persons threatened to severe their genitals or castrate themselves to attain anaphrodisia if prospective clients were chastised. In contemporary times, clients are sometimes viewed as enablers of human trafficking and child trafficking due to boosting their demand."", 'The clients of prostitutes in most countries are overwhelmingly male. The most common age cohort of clients in developing countries are vicenarians (those in their twenties). Finances\nThe affordability of prostitution greatly varies from region to region.

After cultivating a relationship with the child and engendering a false sense of trust, the trafficker will begin engaging the child in prostitution, and use physical, emotional, and psychological abuse to keep the child trapped in a life of prostitution. It is common for traffickers to isolate victims by moving them far away from friends and family, altering their physical appearances, or continuously moving them to new locations. Victims are heavily conditioned to remain loyal to the trafficker and to distrust law enforcement.

If your pH is disrupted, it can open you up for a yeast overgrowth, leading to an infection, Dr. Shepherd says. And that can leave you with vaginal itching, pain during sex, and abnormal discharge, according to the CDC. 5. You’re at a higher risk for STIs. . Sorry, but water doesn’t have magical STI-cleansing properties, unfortunately. Given that it’s kind of tricky to use protection underwater, and especially hard to use it properly, this is pretty problematic. Another important thing to keep in mind, per Dr. Wider: Friction from sex can cause those aforementioned vaginal tears—and that can up your risk of getting an STI, too.', '1 out of every 6 women and 1 in 33 men in America have been the victim of sexual assault or rape in their lifetime. 15 percent of victims are under age of 12. Sexual abuse victims are 3 times more likely to suffer depression, 6 times more likely to suffer post-traumatic stress disorder, 13 times more likely to abuse alcohol and 26 times more likely to abuse drugs than those who have not been sexually abused. Sexual Abuse increases Risk of Substance Abuse\nSexual abuse in any form can lead to major problems for the victims. Substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, poor coping skills, antisocial behavior, depression, anxiety, future victimization, low self-esteem and problems in relationships are all a consequence of sexual abuse. Some studies have suggested that people who are the victims of sexual abuse may have an increased risk for substance abuse. Substances are used by victims for a number of reasons which include: * A mechanism to cope or escape the trauma of sexual abuse\n* A way to reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness\n* A form of self medication\n* To improve self esteem and boost confidence\n* A form of self-destructive behavior or self-harm\nChild or Adolescent Sexual Abuse\nChild or adolescent sexual abuse can be defined as the sexualisation of a child or young person by an adult or peer. The abuse may include touching, penetration, voyeurism, child pornography or intercourse. The abuse may be violent and include rape, threats and physical abuse or it may be less obvious and include grooming a child to be sexual, coercion to participate or peer pressure.', 'During this stage of grooming, the abuser increases the non-sexual touching that will prepare the child for the abuse. For instance, this may including hugs, snuggles, wrestling, and tickling. Other tactics include taking a bath/shower together, swimming in the nude, drying a child off with a towel, giving massages or showing the child pornography. Sandusky was observed showering with some of his victims. At this stage, the perpetrator may also start discussing sexual behaviors and content with the child/adolescent so that they feel more comfortable with this type of material. Ultimately the goal of sexual grooming is to provide the perpetrator the opportunity to offend against the child without detection. In Sandusky’s case, these crimes went on for over 20 years before he was apprehended. These sexual grooming techniques will confuse the child as they believe the person to be a friend or parent-like figure and thus they may fearthat if they report the abuse that their special relationship may end. The abuser may also use threats and coercion once the abuse starts to suggest to the victim that no one will believe them, or that the minor will be blamed for the abuse because they wanted it. As the abuser has also often groomed the victim’s guardians and community, adults often trust the perpetrator and may not be suspicious of the grooming behaviors or changes in the child’s behaviors.'];Activities involving water can increase the vulnerability to sexual abuse primarily due to the isolated and private nature of water sources and the necessity for individuals, particularly women and girls, to access these areas. Often, the journey to collect water or the use of outdoor latrines located near water bodies exposes these individuals to potential abusers when they are alone and away from the safety of their community. Additionally, situations such as bathing or collecting water can inadvertently provide perpetrators with opportunities to exploit the isolation of these settings for committing acts of sexual abuse.;['Alcohol use near water lowers inhibitions.', 'Intoxication near water lowers inhibitions.', 'Water activities offer secluded abuse opportunities.', 'Remote water sources increase isolation risk.', 'Lack of privacy near water increases vulnerability.', 'Darkness near water sources hides abuse.', 'Water obscures abuse evidence.', 'Distraction during water activities reduces awareness.', 'Undressing for water activities reduces defenses.', 'Shared bathing/swimming normalizes touching.', 'Vulnerability during water-related tasks.', 'Water collection exposes women to assault.'];['okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital'];['not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support'];0.4

Blacks and African Americans need to be aware of these risk factors and visit their doctor or clinic regularly to check their blood sugar, blood pressure, urine protein and kidney function. Blacks and African Americans suffer from kidney failure at a significantly higher rate than Caucasians - more than 3 times higher. African Americans constitute more than 35% of all patients in the U.S. receiving dialysis for kidney failure, but only represent 13.2% of the overall U.S. population. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure in African Americans. African Americans are twice as likely to be diagnosed with diabetes as Caucasians. Approximately 4.9 million African Americans over 20 years of age are living with either diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes. The most common type of diabetes in African Americans is type 2 diabetes. The risk factors for this type of diabetes include: family history, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes during pregnancy, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, obesity and physical inactivity.', 'Blacks or African Americans are about 3 times more likely than Whites to develop kidney failure. Blacks or African Americans are 13% of the U.S. population, while representing 35% of those with kidney failure. Black or African-American race is also associated with increased risk for acute kidney injury (AKI). Blacks or African Americans also suffer higher rates of comorbid conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, resulting in higher rates of fair/poor health (age 18+, 22% Blacks or African Americans vs. 16% Whites). Compared to non-Hispanics, Hispanics or Latinos are almost 33% (1.3 times) more likely to receive a diagnosis of kidney failure. Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians and Alaska Natives also have a higher prevalence of kidney disease than Whites. There are disparities in the quality of primary care for patients of different racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups who have kidney disease and kidney disease risk factors. These disparities are related to patient, clinician, clinical, and systemic factors. Patients receiving dialysis in areas with populations that are largely Black or African American, low-income, or of lower educational attainment, are less likely to have received pre-dialysis care from a nephrologist.

Heart failure means that the heart isn\'t able to pump blood as well as it should. Before age 50, African-Americans\' heart failure rate is 20 times higher than that of whites, according to the study.

Being overweight is also a factor because it contributes to a higher rate of diabetes in African-Americans. What is kidney disease? Healthy kidneys do many important jobs. They remove waste products and extra water from your body, help make red blood cells, and help control blood pressure. When you have kidney disease, it means your kidneys are damaged and they cannot do these important jobs well enough. Kidneys can become damaged from a physical injury or a disease like diabetes, high blood pressure, or other disorders.']";Blacks and African Americans are at a higher risk for organ failure, particularly kidney failure, due to several interconnected health and societal factors. First, there is a high prevalence of chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure among African Americans, which are leading contributors to kidney disease.

Lifestyle is a choice, and the risk of developing cancer can be decreased by becoming physically active, losing weight, and eating healthy. States With Highest Rates of Cancer\nCancer rates in the US are highest in the eastern side of the country. Kentucky has the highest incidence with 512 people out of 100,000 developing the disease every year. One of the poorest states in the nation, it has not sufficiently invested in cancer prevention and detection; therefore, the state also has the highest rate of deaths from cancer. Kentucky was founded on the tobacco industry, a legacy that remains today as nearly a quarter of the population smokes cigarettes. This smoking habit explains why lung cancer is higher here than any other state in the nation. The second highest cancer rate is found in Delaware where 490.6 out of every 100,000 residents will develop the disease annually. After being named as one of the states with the highest rates of cancer, Delaware increased its screening and prevention programs which has helped to improve survival and diagnoses rates.', ""There are a couple of contributing factors which could lead to this east of the Mississippi River bias that we also witnessed with overall cancer incidence rates. One big factor is obviously smoking rates. Tobacco products have been decisively linked as a primary contributing factor to lung cancer and a number of other cancers, yet quite a few of the states on this list have a percentage of adult smokers well above the national average of 18%. According to a study from Health.com, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and West Virginia all rank in the top 10 among states with the highest percentage of smokers. In addition, states like Kentucky rely on tobacco production for jobs and state revenue, with the states' farmers responsible for growing 150 million pounds of tobacco products in 2012. Another possible factor is obesity, which has been shown to be a high-risk factor for a number of different types of cancers. Based on a 2012 self-reporting study by the CDC, 13 states have obesity rates above 30%. Four of those 13 states -- Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, and West Virginia -- are among the states with the highest lung cancer occurrence rates. Finally, there's the potential that exposure to trace elements, some of which are known to cause cancer, such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and nickel, in the Appalachian Mountain region could be responsible for this East Coast-versus-West Coast incidence rate bias. In 2011 the U.S. Department of Defense awarded the University of Kentucky's Markey Cancer Center $1.43 million to conduct a three-year study on these elements in soil and water found in eastern Kentucky."", ""Another possible factor is obesity, which has been shown to be a high-risk factor for a number of different types of cancers.

How lung cancer treatments look today\nIn addition to improving risk factor awareness related to lung cancer, biopharmaceutical companies around the globe have introduced new medications and are developing new treatment pathways, which do demonstrate promise for lung cancer sufferers. Since non-small-cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, makes up around 85% of all diagnoses, it will be the primary focus of our discussion. In terms of existing therapies, perhaps none have demonstrated more promise recently than Celgene 's ( NASDAQ: CELG) Abraxane or Pfizer 's ( NYSE:"", ""For women, breast cancer leads to the second most deaths; for men, it's prostate cancer.

Such geographic patterns can reflect a range of factors, such as smoking rates and obesity, as well as poverty and access to health care. Easily the largest geographic variation, according to the American Cancer Society, is for lung cancer, which reflects both historical and ongoing differences in the prevalence of smoking. That's a significant reason why Kentucky, which traditionally has had a large number of smoking, has higher rates of lung cancer than Utah, which has among the nation's lowest percentage of smokers. Here are the states with highest overall incidence of cancer for both men and women, though the numbers vary based on particular types of the disease. 4) In nearly two dozen states, cancer has eclipsed heart disease as the leading cause of death.

A successful graphic designer has an enviable life, choosing clients and earning significant amounts of money. However, be warned: An artist’s style may be very hot one season and turn into a parody the next. People who are unwilling or unable to change could find promising careers declining. Of the nearly 25,000 people who try to enter the field of graphic design each year, only about 60 percent last the first two years, and about 30 percent remain in the field at five years. Paying Your Dues\nThe majority of graphic designers have a four-year degree, usually in product design, art, or art history. Graphic designers must have talent and an understanding of the business world, including issues of finance and production, and should be familiar with computer software such as InDesign, Quark XPress, Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and other painting and graphic design tools. Graphic designers must be able to work in a variety of media and meet deadlines, sizing limits, and financial restrictions, especially those designers who wish to work as freelance graphic designers rather than in-house salaried designers. Basic pre-professional coursework should include design, drawing, computer artwork, and specific knowledge  (for example, anatomy for medical graphics designers) relating to any area of specialization.', 'Advertisement\n1 Career: The insecurities related to career could range from wanting to have a job (for those women who do not work), to being promoted to a higher designation in the company. Often, women in their child-bearing ages are expected to make sacrifices in their career growth for fulfilling family needs. This mounting pressure from the society could cause serious insecurities about growth in the career. A lot of women are also insecure about the amount of money they make, because it often symbolizes their class. 2 Creativity: In a world where most creative professions are male-dominated, it is common for women to feel a certain level of an inferiority complex when they venture out into the creative space. They are often worried they might not be able to carve a niche for themselves because of their gender.

First, the field of design involves significant risk and exposure to both success and failure, which is publicly visible and can lead to feelings of insecurity, especially if individuals doubt their skills or ideas. Additionally, the competitive nature of the industry, where styles and trends can quickly change from one season to the next, contributes to insecurities as designers must continuously adapt or risk their careers declining.

Commercial property insurance will protect the church itself, any other buildings the church owns, and personal property. For example, if a fire breaks out or a storm causes damage to a building, this type of policy will cover any losses, including the cost of repairing and/or rebuilding. To ensure that your policy will cover the total replacement cost, make sure that you opt for coverage that covers the replacement cost of the property, not the actual cash value. Liability Insurance - It used to be that churches didn't have to carry liability insurance, as they were exempt from being sued for any injuries due to negligence. However, times have changed dramatically and this immunity has been eradicated. Today, churches and ministries are subject to the same types of legal action that traditional businesses are sues. This has been evidenced by the many lawsuits that have been filed against countless churches across the nation; particularly lawsuits involving sexual abuse and misconduct."", 'This coverage provides for claims arising from practices associated with employment-related events. It protects a religious organization against claims made by employees alleging discrimination (based on sex, race, age or disability, for example), wrongful termination, harassment and other employment-related issues. Employee Benefits Liability: This coverage provides for claims arising from an error or omission by an employer with regard to the benefits an employee should have received. So if a church staff member should have been enrolled in the health plan but was not due to an oversight, then incurred hospital bills that the health insurance should have paid for, that staff member could sue the church. Workers Compensation: Each state has its own version of workers compensation laws and coverage. In general, workers comp insurance provide income, medical care, and rehabilitation to employees for illness, injury, or death arising out of, and in the course of, their employment whether or not the employee was at fault. Business Auto: Any time a church owns its own vehicles, this coverage is necessary and almost always mandated by state law.']";Insurance companies are cancelling churches primarily because the legal landscape for churches has evolved significantly. Historically, churches benefited from certain immunities that protected them from being sued for negligence, but these immunities have largely been removed, exposing churches to the same types of lawsuits and liabilities as for-profit businesses.

When someone is under the influence of green, they will go on a food binge and consume a large number of calories in one sitting. Needless to say, they won’t make healthy food choices and binge on food like broccoli, salads, and broiled fish. When someone has the munchies, they typically consume foods high in carbs, calories and sugar and often drink massive quantities of alcohol. This kind of high caloric food intake can lead to weight gain.

The munchies occur due to a chemical reaction the brain has when it interacts with THC, the main psychoactive component in marijuana. Researchers believe THC stimulates a feeding hormone that increases senses of smell and taste. You\'re sitting on your couch, sharing marijuana with friends, when all of a sudden you feel it: you\'re really, really hungry. Even though you just ate dinner, you can\'t help but give in to the urge to open that bag of potato chips and eat them all because they taste that good. It\'s not in your head. Chemical compounds in marijuana react with the brain to enhance appetite, creating what is commonly referred to as ""the munchies."" It\'s all connected to the body\'s endocannabinoid system, which helps regulate the brain, immune system, sexual function, metabolism, and mood.

By far, the most suicides among inmates occur soon after incarceration. 1-4 A Hayes study from 2012 found that nearly one-quarter of newly arrested prisoners died within the first 24 hours, and more than half died between 2 days and 4 months of confinement. 2\nAttempted Suicide\nRates of attempted suicide are also high among prisoners. An epidemiologic study from England and Wales by Hawton and colleagues 3 reported that during the years from 2004 to 2009, the incidence of self-harm among male prisoners was 5% to 6%, and 20% to 24% among female prisoners. A history of 5 or more attempts was highly associated with risk for subsequent suicide. 3\nThese attempts were carried out with high suicidal intent, and were often repeated. A 2016 review of the literature by Marzano et al 5 showed that on average, female inmates were likely to commit self-harm 8 times per year, and most near-lethal attempts occurred soon after incarceration. These risks were all significantly reduced when suicide risk management procedures were being followed. 5\nMethods and Opportunities\nMost suicides in prison occur by hanging, when inmates are held in isolation or segregation cells, and at times when observation is light.', 'A history of 5 or more attempts was highly associated with risk for subsequent suicide. 3\nThese attempts were carried out with high suicidal intent, and were often repeated.

These risks were all significantly reduced when suicide risk management procedures were being followed. 5\nMethods and Opportunities\nMost suicides in prison occur by hanging, when inmates are held in isolation or segregation cells, and at times when observation is light. 4,6 Many reports have indicated that successful suicide can occur within only a few inches from a supporting surface or floor. Strangulation by these methods can take several minutes and is accomplished using ligatures fashioned from sheets, clothing, or shoelaces, strung from any secure protrusion. Second to that are injuries from self-cutting and stabbing that cause significant blood loss or injury leading to death. A 2007 report by the World Health Organization 4 pointed to a strong influence of housing assignments in prison on suicide attempts, citing a “disproportionate” number of suicides that occur in solitary housing situations. Within the prison environment, psychological distress about bullying, conflicts with other inmates, disciplinary actions by prison staff, and hearing bad news regarding family or legal matters exacerbate the stress of imprisonment, where feelings of hopelessness and the sudden narrowing of future prospects leads to desperation and suicidal thoughts.', 'prison suicide, jail suicide, suicide risk factors, suicide prevention, mentally ill offenders\nAlthough prison suicide is not a likely occurrence, it is the leading cause of preventable death in jails and correctional facilities ( Way, Miraglia, Sawyer, Beer, & Eddy, 2005. Inmates are particularly at risk during the first 24 hr under custody as they face the reality of incarceration ( Hayes, 1995 ). The risk further increases for detainees and offenders when they are held in detention centers or lockups with no way to post bail, particularly if this is the first incarceration for felony offenses. At this point, inmates are faced with compounded stressors. The jail environment embodies fear, distrust, lack of control, isolation, and shame and is often dehumanizing. Coping with entering this environment, inmates often feel overwhelmed and hopeless, leading some of them to choose suicide as a way to escape. Furthermore, offenders are likely to have several risk factors that predispose them to suicidal behavior, including preexisting thought disorders, alcohol or substance abuse problems, mood disorders, and previous suicide attempt histories ( Way et al., 2005 ). Additionally, Tartaro and Lester (2005) found that prison suicide rates are correlated with suicide rates for adult males in the general U.S. population, pointing to the importance of societal risk factors along with individual factors. This article describes the prevalence of suicide for incarcerated adults, factors associated with suicide risk, methods for assessing suicide risk in this vulnerable population, and current protocols for suicide prevention programs in jails and prisons.', 'Screening is Only the Beginning\nWhile suicide screening at intake has significantly reduced deaths during the first 24 hours of confinement, suicides are now more likely to be evenly distributed during confinement. According to the most recent national study of jail suicides, 23% occurred within first 24 hours, 27% occurred between 2 and 14 days, and 20% between 1 and 4 months. This data suggests that there is need to target other high-risk periods, including when placed in segregation and upon return from court hearings that resulted in bad news. The challenge, of course, is to develop a system that is alert to these sensitive points in the incarceration timeline. One way is to train staff to be more attentive to the behavior of inmates returning from visits or after telephone calls. Making the Most of a Bad Outcome\nEven with a prevention plan in operation, a suicide can take place. It is a devastating situation for the inmate, family, and correctional staff. A thorough mortality review can help evaluate if the current suicide prevention program can be improved. This review should focus on organizational culture, system changes, and staff knowledge rather than seek to lay blame on any one person or department. Here is a summary of the recommended process for a morbidity and mortality review as discussed by Lindsay Hayes, MS when he spoke at a recent NCCHC conference.', 'In 2010, the National Institute of Corrections released a report on jail suicides, outlining possible explanations for the problem. In short, they said, jails tended to exacerbate suicidal behavior: Story continues below advertisement\nExperts theorize that two primary causes for jail suicide exist: ( 1) jail environments are conducive to suicidal behavior and (2) the inmate is facing a crisis situation. From the inmate’s perspective, certain features of the jail environment enhance suicidal behavior: fear of the unknown, distrust of an authoritarian environment, perceived lack of control over the future, isolation from family and significant others, shame of incarceration, and perceived dehumanizing aspects of incarceration. In addition, certain factors are prevalent among inmates facing a crisis situation that could predispose them to suicide: recent excessive drinking and/or drug use, recent loss of stabilizing resources, severe guilt or shame over the alleged offense, current mental illness, prior history of suicidal behavior, and approaching court date. In addition, some inmates simply are (or become) ill equipped to handle the common stresses of confinement. The report goes on to note that to prevent suicides, personnel need additional training, constant observation for people on suicide watch and a better screening process.'];The timeframe of July to September may see more inmate suicides due to a combination of environmental and psychological factors not explicitly detailed in the passage. However, it's important to consider general stressors mentioned that could intensify during these months. For example, the psychological impact of experiencing incarceration can include fear, isolation, and hopelessness which may peak following the initial period of confinement. This aligns with observations that the risk of suicide remains high during the early stages of incarceration, a period that could overlap with these months for many inmates.

If technological advances were leveraged to benefit facility operations and staff safety, that viewpoint would be accurate; however, limited funding often results in corrections being unable to spend money on technology that would benefit facilities and staff. Meanwhile, inmates are able to benefit from technological advances, especially as we see an increase in the miniaturization of devices. Consider how small some communication devices are today. The smaller the device, the easier it is to smuggle inside a facility and, in turn, for the inmate to conceal the device. As technology continues to advance, so do concerns about contraband and associated challenges.', 'Since the most dangerous inmates are the ones correctional facilities are required to keep for longer periods of time, it increases the potential for repeated violence within facilities. When inmates attack each other, staff must intervene to take control of the situation. This intervention puts staff at risk. However, it is not just inmate-on-inmate violence that causes concern for staff safety; violent inmates also target staff.

Advancements in technology\nAt first glance, technological advances appear to be a benefit as opposed to a concern for corrections in the coming year. If technological advances were leveraged to benefit facility operations and staff safety, that viewpoint would be accurate;', 'A prisoner who cannot earn any incentive gaintime has zero motivation to follow the rules and behave well. Why should he respect the FDOC Correctional Officers and follow the rules if his or her served time is fixed at 100% of his sentence? The worst that can happen is he or she will go to the Box for a month of confinement, something some prisoners prefer to living in an open dorm. It is a simple Correctional Officer safety requirement that all non-life prisoners must be able to earn incentive gaintime for good behavior. It may have been election-wise twenty years ago to enact laws denying earnable gaintime for certain crimes, but it is a very foolish policy once in prison and directly endangers the safety of Correctional Officers\nAnd of course, to maximize the safety of Correctional Officers by motivating good behavior by prisoners, it is exactly those prisoners with violent crime convictions who most need a chance to earn 65% gaintime (and so would also require the Legislature to amend that part of 10-20-Life, PRR, and a few other laws that now forbid earning any gaintime through current language such as “ . . . and the defendant is not eligible for statutory gaintime under s. 944.275”), so that all non-lifers are equally motivated to behave well in prison so they can go home as soon as possible. It makes no sense at all as far as the safety of Correctional Officers is concerned to have prisoners with violent crime convictions earning less incentive gaintime than non-violent crime prisoners: which group of prisoners is potentially more of a danger to Corre', 'In an effort to provide the public with an answer, I would first like to note that people tend to be more motivated by a loss than by a gain. This holds true in how corrections deals with deviant behavior amongst those who are incarcerated. To have or have not\nWhen we are looking to punish deviance, we remove an item of value from the inmate (punishment by removal). This is done in the hopes that the inmate will want what was taken from them and, in their effort to get back what was taken, learn to comply with the rules and regulations of the institution. Signs listing special restrictions for inmates at the Washington Corrections Center in Shelton, Wash. are shown. ( AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)\nWhen an inmate gets a charge for not following the rules, their punishment can consist of loss of recreational privileges, loss of contact visits, loss of commutation time, loss of TV, etc. This loss is not taken lightly because the inmate has already grown accustomed to what they have. When they are faced with the possibility of a loss of something that was previously granted to them, they compare the situation that they are in (having) to the situation that they could face (have not) and, with that comparison in mind, they may choose to act accordingly. Again, this is how correctional staff maintains their sense of authority. If inmates were not granted anything, what would correctional staff have at their disposal that would help them maintain control?', 'Officials in these situations are worried about any actions that threaten to change conditions within the prison walls or limit their power. In particular, officials may seek to punish those who have gained legal skills and try to help their fellow prisoners with legal matters. Prisoners with legal skills can be particularly threatening to prison management who would like to limit the education and political training of prisoners. Some jailhouse lawyers report that officials have taken away their possessions, put them in solitary confinement on false charges, denied them parole, or transferred them to other facilities where they were no longer able to communicate with the prisoners they had been helping. With this in mind, it is very important for those of you who are interested in both legal and political activism to keep in contact with people in the outside world. One way to do this is by making contact with people and organizations in the outside community who do prisoners’ rights or other civil rights work. You can also try to find and contact reporters who may be sensitive to, and interested in, prison issues. These can include print newspapers and newsletters, broadcast television and radio shows, and online sites. It is always possible that organizing from the outside aimed at the correct pressure points within prison management can have a dramatic effect on conditions for you on the inside. Certain court decisions that have established standards for prisoner legal rights can be powerful weapons in your activism efforts.']";Prisons are concerned with the potential of inmates gaining access to advanced technology because it significantly increases the risks of contraband and security breaches within the facility. As technological devices become smaller and more sophisticated, they can be easily smuggled into prisons, allowing inmates to conceal them and potentially use them for unlawful communications or planning disruptive activities. Additionally, aging infrastructure and insufficient funding for technological updates exacerbate these risks, making it harder to detect and prevent the smuggling of such devices, thereby posing a heightened threat to overall facility security and staff safety.;['Escape attempts endanger public safety.', 'Gang activity threatens prison order and security.', 'Weapons threaten safety.', 'Inmate violence endangers staff and other inmates.', 'Contraband threatens security and order.', 'Unauthorized communication aids criminal activity.', 'Drug use threatens health, security, and rehabilitation.', 'Cell phones facilitate criminal activity.', 'Inmates with outside resources pose security threats.', 'Access to technology enables criminal activity.', 'Inmate access to internet poses security risks.'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital'];['not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support'];0.2727272727272727

The SAS and SDS students then left the gym site at Morningside Park and returned to Columbia's campus, where they took over Hamilton Hall, a building housing both classrooms and the offices of the Columbia College Administration. Activist separation\nAn important aspect of the 1968 Columbia University protests was the manner in which activists were separated along racial lines. The morning after the initial takeover of Hamilton Hall, the 60 African-American students involved with the protest asked the predominantly white SDS students to leave. The SAS decision to separate themselves from SDS came as a total surprise to the latter group's members. SAS wanted autonomy in what they were doing at that point in the protest, because their goals and methods diverged in significant ways from SDS. While both the SAS and the SDS shared the goal of preventing the construction of the new gymnasium, the two groups held different agendas. The overarching goal of the SDS extended beyond the single issue of halting the construction of the gym."", 'Following a peaceful demonstration inside the Low Library administration building on March 27, 1968, the Columbia Administration placed on probation six anti-war Columbia student activists, who were collectively nicknamed ""The IDA Six,"" for violating its ban on indoor demonstrations. Morningside Park gymnasium\nColumbia\'s plan to construct what activists described as a segregated gymnasium in city-owned Morningside Park fueled anger among the nearby Harlem community. Opposition began in 1965 during the mayoral campaign of John Lindsay, who opposed the project. By 1967 community opposition had become more militant. One of the causes for dispute was the gym\'s proposed design. Due to the topography of the area, Columbia\'s campus at Morningside Heights to the west was more than 100 feet (30 m) above the adjacent neighborhood of Harlem to the east. The proposed design would have an upper level to be used as a Columbia gym, and a lower level to be used as a community center. By 1968, concerned students and community members saw the planned separate east and west entrances as an attempt to circumvent the Civil Rights Act of 1964, then a recent federal law that banned racially segregated facilities. In addition, others were concerned with the appropriation of land from a public park. Harlem activists opposed the construction because, despite being on public land and a park, Harlem residents would get only limited access to the facility.', 'It was for these reasons that the project was labelled by some as ""Gym Crow"". Since 1958 the University had evicted more than seven thousand Harlem residents from Columbia-controlled properties—85 percent of whom were African American or Puerto Rican. Many Harlem residents paid rent to the University. Black students at a 40th anniversary event said their bitterness evolved from discrimination, that unlike white students their identifications were constantly checked, and that black women were told not to register for difficult courses. A ""stacking system"" that put all the former black football players in the same position was described.

It was of great importance to SAS that there was no destruction of files and personal property in faculty and administrative offices in Hamilton Hall, which would have reinforced negative stereotypes of black protesters destroying property then popular in the media. Having sole occupancy of Hamilton Hall thus allowed SAS to avoid any potential conflict with SDS about destruction of university property, as well as with other issues. Thus, the members of the SAS requested that the white radicals begin their own, separate protest so that the black students could put all of its focus into preventing the university from building the gym. The African-American students said that the European-American students could not understand the protest of the gymnasium as deeply, as its architectural plans were developed in a segregationist fashion. In addition, the African-American students knew that police would not be as violent against a group of black students, to prevent riots due to the fact that Martin Luther King Jr. had been killed three weeks prior. What began as a unified effort would soon become a tension-filled standoff between black students and white students as the SAS began to meet separately from other protesters and secluding whites, with each group occupying a separate side of the building. There was minimal communication between the SDS and SAS which led to decreased solidarity between the two forces. An agreement would soon be made between the SDS and the SAS to separate white and black demonstrators. Soon after, the whites left Hamilton Hall and moved to Low Library, which housed the President's office.""]";"Students at Columbia University have been protesting for a variety of reasons related to both local issues and broader societal concerns.

More so, teachers treat their students like their own. So as second parents, teachers are ultimately concerned with shaping the lives of the students under their care. A simple counseling act means a lot to the students. Reaching out to them means asking them how they feel, what burdens them, and what makes them sad or happy. Talking to my students will give me the best chance of understanding their essences. It’s my way of connecting. I am certain that mentoring is not only about teaching them concepts but it goes beyond that.', '2. Everything a teacher does is to help better their students. Teachers learn how they can help each and every kid they come in contact with. Not just educationally, but emotionally. A teacher can help students grow and mature into better people. Young children learn from what they see, and they will often follow a teacher\'s lead. 3. Teachers don\'t accept failure, and they push you to better yourself. Everyone has felt like they weren\'t enough or that they absolutely could never learn that hard math equation. Teachers don\'t accept ""I can\'t"" as an answer, and they help you get through your roadblocks.', 'Teachers are consistently searching for better ways to reach their students. They are never happy with the status quo. Teachers often spend their own money on the things they need to run their classroom. Teachers want to inspire others around them, beginning with their students but also including parents, other teachers and their administration. Teachers work in an endless cycle. They work hard to get each student from point A to point B and then start over the next year. Teachers understand that classroom management is a part of their job, but it is often one of their least favorite things to handle. Teachers understand that students deal with different, sometimes challenging, situations at home and often go above and beyond to help a student cope with those situations. Teachers love engaging in meaningful professional development and despise time-consuming, sometimes pointless professional development. Teachers want to be role models for all of their students.', 'Can you identify one strategy you’ve been using that has helped you to be successful? Can you identify one strategy you want to try using more often? 2. Help students understand that teachers want to help: Asking students of any age why an adult would choose teaching as a career can be an eye-opening—and often humorous—activity. Have students pause and reflect in small groups about why they think Teacher X became a teacher. This is extra fun if Teacher X can visit your classroom to hear the brainstormed ideas. Guide students to the final answer: “ Teachers become teachers because they like to help.” I’ve used this exercise at the beginning of a year for relationship-building and to show students that I care about them and want to help them.', 'They do so despite the fact that there is little or no scientific evidence that learning styles operate in a significant way, except as learning preferences (Pashler, McDaniel, Rohrer & Bjork, 2009). Although permissive-indulgent teachers establish course requirements and deadlines, they tend to be flexible in enforcing them and sometimes make special arrangements with, and allowances for, individual students on a case-by-case basis. They are eager to help students succeed, even if it means lowering standards for success, including by offering certain individuals extra credit opportunities. They spend countless hours working with students who ask for help. Of particular significance is their belief that students’ efforts to succeed are at least as deserving of reward as the outcome of those efforts, as embodied in test scores and other performance assessments. One observer invoked the addiction literature in describing these teachers as “co-dependent enablers” of their students’ lack of motivation, irresponsibility and other academic problems (Daniel, 2009). Authoritative teachers, like authoritative parents, employ a blend of high involvement and firm but fair discipline. They care about their teaching and their students, but they reward outcome, not effort. These teachers see students as responsible adults, so although they are always willing to help, they are careful not to create dependency or to let themselves be exploited or manipulated. They reward academic success with praise as well as high grades, they encourage students to try harder when they need to, and they grant requests for special consideration only if disability or other circumstances clearly justify doing so under school policies.']";Teachers are always willing to help students primarily because they view their role as extending beyond mere academic instruction to include emotional and personal support.

In general, value is destroyed if an activity is over designed or under designed. 3.', 'A Sustainable Strategic Position Requires Trade-offs\nAccording to Porter, a sustainable advantage cannot be guaranteed by simply choosing a unique position, as competitors will imitate a valuable position in one of the two following ways: 1. A competitor can choose to reposition itself to match the superior performer. 2. A competitor can seek to match the benefits of a successful position while maintaining its existing position (known as straddling). Thus, in order for a strategic position to be sustainable there must be trade-offs with other positions. "" A trade-off means that more of one thing necessitates less of another"" (p. 68). Trade-offs occur when activities are incompatible and arise for three reasons: 1. A company known for delivering one kind of value may lack credibility and confuse customers or undermine its own reputation by delivering another kind of value or attempting to deliver two inconsistent things at the same time.', '2. Trade-offs arise from activities themselves. Different positions require different product configurations, different equipment, different employee behavior, different skills, and different management systems. In general, value is destroyed if an activity is over designed or under designed. 3. Trade-offs arise from limits on internal coordination and control. By choosing to compete in one way and not the other, management is making its organizational priorities clear. In contrast, companies that try to be all things to all customers, often risk confusion amongst its employees, who then attempt to make day-to-day operating decisions without a clear framework. Moreover, trade-offs create the need for choice and protect against repositioners and straddlers. Thus, strategy can also be defined as making trade-offs in competing.']";Trade-offs are crucial to the success of a business because they necessitate making choices that align with a company’s strategic positioning, ensuring resources are optimally allocated to areas that provide the greatest value. According to Porter, these trade-offs prevent a business from trying to meet incompatible objectives, which can dilute a company's brand, confuse customers, or result in inefficiencies. Additionally, by establishing clear trade-offs, businesses can avoid the pitfalls of straddling different market positions, which might undermine their competitive advantage and lead to operational confusion.;['Strategic trade-offs define competitive advantage.', 'Balancing cost and benefit is crucial.', 'Trade-offs prevent being all things to all people.', 'Prioritization is key for effective trade-offs.', 'Resource limitations necessitate trade-offs.', 'Effective trade-offs maximize return on investment.', 'Understanding trade-offs improves decision-making.', 'Robust strategies incorporate trade-offs.', 'Trade-offs enhance the value proposition.', 'Trade-offs mitigate risks and enable growth.', 'Trade-offs focus resources on high-impact areas.', 'Opportunity costs are inherent in all choices.'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support'];0.5

Disadvantages\nBecause there are no variables manipulated, there is no way to statistically analyze the results. Many scientists regard this type of study as very unreliable and ‘unscientific’. In addition, the results of observational studies are not repeatable, and so there can be no replication of the experiment and reviewing of the results.

Whilst there are some valid concerns about the statistical validity, as long as the limitations are understood by the researcher, this type of study is an invaluable scientific tool. Whilst the results are always open to question and to different interpretations, there is no doubt that they are preferable to performing no research at all.

On July 6, 1846, U.S. Secretary of State John C. Calhoun, on behalf of President Tyler, formally recognized Hawaii\'s independence under the reign of Kamehameha III. As a result of the recognition of Hawaiian independence, the Hawaiian Kingdom entered into treaties with the major nations of the world and established over ninety legations and consulates in multiple seaports and cities. The kingdom would continue for another 21 years until its overthrow in 1893 with the fall of the House of Kalākaua.

There were many Americans who wanted the resources of the Hawaiian Islands. At this time, sugar was the major product of the islands and Americans wanted control of that resource. Finally, there was competition with other powers. There was concern, for example, that the British would take the islands if the US did not. This would give the British the sugar as well as a base for their navy. This would enlarge the power of the British Empire instead of helping the US gain power.']";"America's interest in overthrowing the Hawaiian Kingdom stemmed from multiple strategic and economic reasons. Firstly, America saw potential military advantages, as control over Hawaii meant having a naval base crucial for projecting power across the central Pacific, enhancing U.S. military reach. Additionally, economic interests, particularly in Hawaii's thriving sugar industry, motivated U.S. involvement; many American businessmen were already established on the islands, reaping profits from sugar plantations. Furthermore, the strategic location of Hawaii served as a key point between Asia and the U.S. Pacific Coast, raising concerns over other powers, notably the British, establishing dominance in the region if the U.S. did not act.

Yet German immigration had peaked in the 1870s.” 4. Immigrants take good jobs from U.S. citizens. Ask students what kinds of jobs they think immigrants are taking. According to the American Immigration Council, a nonpartisan group, research indicates there is little connection between immigrant labor and unemployment rates of native-born workers. Two trends—better education and an aging population—have resulted in a decrease in the number of workers born in the United States who are willing or available to take low-paying jobs. Across all industries and occupations, though, immigrants who are naturalized citizens and non-citizens are outnumbered by workers born in the United States ( see Table 1.7 ). Another version of this myth is that it is undocumented immigrants who are taking jobs. However, the U.S. civilian workforce included 8 million unauthorized immigrants in 2014, which accounts for only 5 percent of the entire workforce.', 'Now, as unemployment rises in America, Americans want these menial jobs but many migrants already have taken the jobs. This can lead to increased social tension as Americans believe that their jobs are being taken. Migrants work at incredibly low wages. Americans who are desperate for work are now often expected to work at these incredibly low wages too, which they can’t afford to do, leading to increased poverty in America. Many companies are now also replacing American labour with cheaper migrant labour, also increasing unemployment rates are people are forced out of their jobs. While legal Mexican migrants are working & paying taxes, they often send money they earn back to their families in Mexico, rather than spending it in America, which can effect the country’s economy as there is less money being spent on products which are taxed in America. Conversely, the increased amount of money being sent back to Mexico is helping its economy greatly as people now have money to spend on goods and services. As people move out of Mexico, pressure on land, social services and jobs is being relieved. Unemployment will fall and health services will no longer be over capacity as the population is reduced. The problem, however, arises when the young and skilled workforce leaves, resulting in a shortage of potential workers to fill these newly freed jobs and to work in these social services.', 'Lastly, there is a myth that immigrants take jobs ""Americans"" would have otherwise.

This tends to happen more when there are more immigrants, and especially more from one region or country. For example, immigrants have been hated when they were too different in terms of religion (Catholics and Jews) or in terms of economic status (too many poor ones).

IN BRIEF\nContrary to popular belief, immigrants do not take away jobs from American workers. Instead, they create new jobs by forming new businesses, spending their incomes on American goods and services, paying taxes and raising the productivity of U.S. businesses. Immigrants are good for the economy, not the other way around. A U.S. Department of Labor study prepared by the Bush Administration noted that the perception that immigrants take jobs away from American workers is ""the most persistent fallacy about immigration in popular thought"" because it is based on the mistaken assumption that there is only a fixed number of jobs in the economy. Experts note that immigrants are blamed for unemployment because Americans can see the jobs immigrants fill but not the jobs they create through productivity, capital formation and demand for goods and services. Immigrants pay more than $90 billion in taxes every year and receive only $5 billion in welfare. Without their contributions to the public treasury, the economy would suffer enormous losses. ACLU POLICY\nThe ACLU recognizes that the U.S., like every country, has the right to control who enters the country and to enforce the integrity of its internationally recognized borders.', 'Myth Number 2: Immigrants take jobs away from Americans. Fact: Immigrants do not take jobs away from Americans. Here’s why: Berkshire County has shown a shrinking labor force over the past few years and needs immigrant labor to fill jobs. Between 2000 and 2004, 511 % of employment growth in Massachusetts was due to new immigrants. Immigrants now make up 17% of the Massachusetts labor force. Immigrants are extremely hard working often taking on 2-3 jobs to support family both in the U.S. and abroad. Immigrants often fill labor-intensive jobs that American citizens are not choosing to do.']";Americans may perceive that immigrants are taking their jobs due to several factors: social and economic insecurities, misperceptions about the job market, and fear of competition. During times of economic downturn or when unemployment rates rise, as mentioned in the passage, Americans might become increasingly concerned about job security and thus view immigrants as competitors for the limited available jobs. Additionally, there is a common misconception that the job market is a zero-sum game, where more jobs for immigrants mean fewer jobs for native-born citizens, despite research showing that immigrants often take jobs that complement rather than compete with the American workforce. Furthermore, high visibility of immigrants in certain job sectors can lead to exaggerated perceptions of economic threat. This issue is compounded by myths and misinformation, such as the notion that immigrants take jobs that Americans are willing to do, emphasizing the need for accurate information and public education on the dynamics of immigration and the labor market.;['Fear of job displacement by cheaper labor.', 'Competition for limited jobs during economic downturns.', 'Immigrants took low-wage jobs Americans avoided.', 'Concerns about wage depression for low-skilled workers.', 'Employers hired undocumented workers for low wages.', 'Anti-immigrant sentiment fueled by unemployment anxieties.', 'Economic anxieties exploited by politicians.', 'Immigrants scapegoated for economic hardship.', 'Myth of a fixed number of jobs.', 'Nativist sentiment and historical prejudice.', 'Cultural differences fueled anxieties and stereotypes.', 'Strain on social services and tax burden.'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.5714285714285714

All kinds of violent things happened, including one event where 2,000 people were dragged out of prisons and killed by the mobs in order to ""force"" justice. The government, and Robespierre, decided that someone had to get control of the situation. The solution, they thought, was to take matters into their own hands. This led to violence on the part of the government. They executed Louis XIV and the Reign of Terror began. Many who opposed the revolution were executed, as well as many who probably posed no threat at all but were suspected or even very loosely associated with those who did.

In April 1790, was elected president of the powerful Jacobin political club. After the downfall of the monarchy in August 1792, Robespierre was elected first deputy for Paris to the National Convention. The convention abolished the monarchy, declared France a republic and put the king on trial for treason, all measures strongly supported by Robespierre. The king was executed in January 1793. In the period after the king's execution, tensions in the convention resulted in a power struggle between the Jacobins and the more moderate Girondins. The Jacobins used the power of the mob to take control and the Girondin leaders were arrested. Control of the country passed to the Committee of Public Safety, of which Robespierre was a member. He rapidly became the dominant force on the committee. Against a backdrop of the threat of foreign invasion and increasing disorder in the country, the committee began the 'Reign of Terror', ruthlessly eliminating all those considered enemies of the revolution.""]";"Robespierre's insistence on the execution of King Louis XVI was heavily influenced by his radical political beliefs and his leadership role within the Jacobin Club, which strongly advocated for extreme measures against the nobility to protect the French Revolution.

Modern ketchup emerged in the early years of the 20th century, out of a debate over the use of sodium benzoate as a preservative in condiments. Harvey W. Wiley, the ""father"" of the Food and Drug Administration in the US, challenged the safety of benzoate which was banned in the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act . In response, entrepreneurs including Henry J. Heinz, pursued an alternative recipe that eliminated the need for that preservative. Katherine Bitting, a microbotanist working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, carried out research that proved in 1909 that increasing the sugar and vinegar content of the product would prevent spoilage without use of artificial preservatives. She was assisted by her husband, Arvil Bitting, an official at that agency. Prior to Heinz (and his fellow innovators), commercial tomato ketchups of that time were watery and thin, in part due to the use of unripe tomatoes, which were low in pectin. They had less vinegar than modern ketchups; by pickling ripe tomatoes, the need for benzoate was eliminated without spoilage or degradation in flavor. But the changes driven by the desire to eliminate benzoate also produced changes that some experts (such as Andrew F. Smith) believe were key to the establishment of tomato ketchup as the dominant American condiment.', 'Ketchup’s success was due in part because it could be kept for up to a year. Still, preservation of tomato ketchups proved challenging. Since tomato-growing season was short, makers of ketchup had to solve the problem of preserving tomato pulp year round. Some producers handled and stored the product so poorly that the resulting sauce contained contaminants like bacteria, spores, yeast, and mold—leading French cookbook author Pierre Blot to call commercial ketchup “filthy, decomposed and putrid” in 1866. Early investigations into commercial ketchup found that it contained potentially unsafe levels of preservatives, namely coal tar, which was sometimes added to achieve the a red color, and sodium benzoate, an additive that retarded spoilage. By the end of the 19th Century, benzoates were seen as particularly harmful to health. At the forefront of the war against them was one Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley, who maintained that the use of these harmful preservatives was unnecessary if high quality ingredients were used and handled properly. ( See “ Chemicals Within Us .”) Wiley partnered with a Pittsburgh man named Henry J. Heinz who had started producing ketchup in 1876. Heinz was also convinced American consumers did not want chemicals in their ketchup.', 'Ketchup as a vegetable - Wikipedia\nKetchup as a vegetable\nLanguage\nWatch\nEdit\nThe ketchup as a vegetable controversy refers to proposed United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) regulations, early in the presidency of Ronald Reagan, that intended to provide more flexibility in meal planning to local school lunch administrators coping with National School Lunch Plan subsidy cuts enacted by the Omnibus Regulation Acts of 1980 and 1981. The regulations allowed administrators the opportunity to credit items not explicitly listed that met nutritional requirements. While ketchup was not mentioned in the original regulations, pickle relish was used as an example of an item that could count as a vegetable. A similar controversy arose in 2011, when Congress passed a bill prohibiting the USDA from increasing the amount of tomato paste required to constitute a vegetable; the bill allowed pizza with two tablespoons (30 mL) of tomato paste to qualify as a vegetable.

( See “ Chemicals Within Us .”) Wiley partnered with a Pittsburgh man named Henry J. Heinz who had started producing ketchup in 1876. Heinz was also convinced American consumers did not want chemicals in their ketchup. In answer to the benzoate controversy, Heinz developed a recipe that used ripe, red tomatoes—which have more of the natural preservative called pectin than the scraps other manufacturers used—and dramatically increased the amount of vinegar and to reduce risk of spoilage. Heinz began producing preservative-free ketchup, and soon dominated the market. In 1905, the company had sold five million bottles of ketchup. With the rise of commercial ketchup, recipes for the condiment slowly vanished from cookbooks. Home cooks found that homemade ketchup just didn’t taste “right.”', 'Of course, prior to the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 (and as Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle famously showed), the food manufacturing business as a whole could largely be described with these same memorable adjectives. But ketchup was particularly bad. In fact, when you opened a bottle, the contents could literally kill you. The reasons ketchup was such vile, potentially deadly slop are varied, but start with the shortness of the tomato season. Lasting from mid-August until mid-October, ketchup could only be made fresh for two months out of the year. However, by the late 19th century, Americans were used to expecting ketchup year around. A year’s worth of ketchup could not be made in two months, so manufacturers preserved tomato pulp to meet yearly expectations. It wasn’t a bad strategy, except for the fact that they did so with the same carelessness, filthiness, and lack of quality control that was endemic in the food manufacturing industry at the time. Entire barrels of pulp were stored so badly that, when open, they were found to be filled with mold, yeast, spores, and deadly bacteria. At a time when no one else cared, Heinz was obsessed with making his products as pure as possible.']";"The ketchup controversy arose primarily due to debates over the use of sodium benzoate as a preservative in ketchup and other condiments. Harvey W. Wiley, often regarded as the ""father"" of the FDA, challenged the safety of benzoate, leading to its ban in the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. In response, Henry J. Heinz and other entrepreneurs adapted their recipes to eliminate the need for this preservative, opting instead for increased levels of natural preservatives like sugar and vinegar which maintained product safety without artificial additives. This shift not only responded to health concerns but also markedly improved the quality and consistency of ketchup, helping to establish it as a staple condiment in American cuisine.";['Debate over ketchup refrigeration', 'French school ketchup ban', 'Health concerns about ingredients', 'Public perception of ketchup evolved', 'Regional variations in ketchup use', 'Ketchup use considered immature', 'Marketing and branding strategies', 'Chicago hot dog tradition excludes ketchup', 'Heinz mass production standardized ketchup', 'Customer service issues with ketchup orders', 'Controversy over colored EZ Squirt ketchup', 'Misinformation about ketchup ingredients'];['vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support'];0.0

The absence of a romantic partner or a close family seems magnified during this busy time when we’re all supposed to be going to parties, exchanging gifts, and enjoying jolly feelings with loved ones. One way to deal with the feelings of loneliness is to rethink your expectations. For example, realizing that it\'s just fine to take a good friend (instead of ""the perfect date"") to a holiday party, or that the imperfect love of a difficult family member still counts as love, has helped many people feel less lonely. It\'s also important to realize that few people’s lifestyles truly measure up to “movie standards” of perfect living, and in doing so, shift your focus to all the great things you do have in your life. Note: Social media can create significant amounts of stress in this area, so do your best to count your blessings instead of comparing yourself to others and the life they portray online.

The holiday season is both joyful and stressful at once. There is family to get along with, gifts to buy and return, people to visit, activities to throw yourself into, plenty of festive food to eat, sales to rush to, and parties to plan and attend. Topped off with the excitement of New Year\'s Eve, your adrenaline has probably been pumping a lot of the time during the Christmas and New Year\'s period. Returning to the usual routine and probably quieter workplace than normal can dampen your spirits just by the absence of exciting things to do and look forward to. Equally, if your Christmas and New Year\'s Eve period wasn\'t as enjoyable as you had hoped, you can be left feeling down about the lack of enjoyment you\'d expected and this can sour your mood. Expecting to feel a little low is a way of telling yourself that this is a normal feeling and that it will soon pass once the routine re-establishes itself. Look at your past experiences to enlighten you as to your normal post-holiday feelings. Do you always fall into a slump after the holiday season? If you have spent period after last two holidays in despair, then the chances of this post holiday period continuing in despair are high.', ""Sometimes even having high hopes for the season can lead to holiday stress and sadness. The over-commercialization of the holidays can create the expectation that people are supposed to feel nonstop joy and holiday cheer, which can create pressure to feel a very specific way, adding yet another stressor to an already hectic time of year. Because the holidays mark an impending new year, people may also begin to reflect on the past year and experience feelings of regret or failure. They might think about the goals they had and the things they wanted to accomplish and feel upset if they did not meet those expectations. It isn't just adults who are prone to seasonal sadness. Changes in routines, dealing with family problems, missing friends, and feeling stressed around the holidays can all contribute to feelings of sadness and depression in kids. Watch for the signs and talk to your child’s pediatrician if you are concerned. Treatment\nUnless you are diagnosed with major depression, your doctor probably won’t prescribe medications to treat your holiday depression symptoms. In many cases, holiday depression can be managed with lifestyle changes and social support. Your doctor may refer you to a mental health professional for psychotherapy ."", '2 \ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff Some people wish they could be with family, but can’t; others mourn the relationships with family that they wish they had or long for closer connections with friends. Similarly, some may wish for a supportive romantic relationship and find themselves feeling especially isolated during the holidays. 1 \ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\nWhile it may be uncomfortable to feel lonely, it’s also OK to feel this way. Talking to others who may share your feelings (either via the internet or in real life) can help you to feel less alone in your situation. Rethink Your Expectations\nPart of why holidays feel more lonely for many people is that our society has high expectations for this time of year. The absence of a romantic partner or a close family seems magnified during this busy time when we’re all supposed to be going to parties, exchanging gifts, and enjoying jolly feelings with loved ones. One way to deal with the feelings of loneliness is to rethink your expectations. For example, realizing that it\'s just fine to take a good friend (instead of ""the perfect date"") to a holiday party, or that the imperfect love of a difficult family member still counts as love, has helped many people feel less lonely. It\'s also important to realize that few people’s lifestyles truly measure up to “movie standards” of perfect living, and in doing so, shift your focus to all the great things you do have in your life.', ""Financial stress: Overextending yourself financially or struggling to afford gifts for family and friends can create an added burden of financial stress. Isolation and loneliness: Not being able to spend the holidays with your family and friends can make the holiday season seem especially lonely. Unrealistic expectations: Sometimes even having high hopes for the season can lead to holiday stress and sadness. The over-commercialization of the holidays can create the expectation that people are supposed to feel nonstop joy and holiday cheer, which can create pressure to feel a very specific way, adding yet another stressor to an already hectic time of year. Because the holidays mark an impending new year, people may also begin to reflect on the past year and experience feelings of regret or failure. They might think about the goals they had and the things they wanted to accomplish and feel upset if they did not meet those expectations. It isn't just adults who are prone to seasonal sadness.""]";Holidays might not feel as festive anymore primarily due to high societal expectations and the resulting pressures. Many people experience feelings of loneliness and stress when their holiday experiences do not match the idealized versions often portrayed in media or expected by society, such as spending time with a large, joyful family or having a romantic partner. Additionally, the commercialization of holidays can lead to financial stress and disappointment if personal and family moments do not live up to commercial standards, causing individuals to feel a lack of holiday cheer or even sadness.;['Financial stress diminishes festive cheer.', 'Unrealistic expectations breed stress and anxiety.', 'Exhaustion from over-scheduling saps joy.', 'Toxic family dynamics increase pressure.', 'Over-commercialization overshadows true meaning.', 'Shift from purpose to mere obligation.', 'Social media comparisons fuel discontent.', 'Media portrays unrealistic holiday ideals.', 'Loneliness and isolation dampen spirits.', 'Grief and loss intensify sadness.', 'Increased social pressure to participate.', 'Repetitive traditions lose novelty.', 'Commercialism replaces genuine connection.', 'Past regrets and failures cloud present joy.', 'Trauma associated with holidays.', 'Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) impacts mood.'];['Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Okay'];['support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.0

The third part of this soliloquy is that Juliet now is taking very risky actions, like drinking the potion, her soliloquy tells us about what she is thinking, she thinks very careful to take the potion and if she does what could happen, but the finally takes the potion. This decision Juliet took shows us how in love with Romeo is and how she has changed since she met Romeo. Juliet’s character mainly changed because when she met Romeo she started feeling more and more confident about herself, Romeo made Juliet’s opinions to change a lot. She felt more confident when talking with Friar Lawrence, which she asked for a potion to “kill her”. Juliet really changed with County Paris, at the beginning she was very obedient and polite, but when she met Romeo, she started to tell the truth about him, which she didn’t really love him. “… he shall not make me a joyful bride… ” This shows that Juliet’s feelings about marrying Paris will not make her happy. Not only Juliet’s character changed, her emotions also changed, in Act 4 scene 2 Juliet shows her relationship with her father, which is not very close, as they are discussing about her marriage with Paris. In this act Juliet feels paranoia, she is confused and she is in a state of terror. Juliet’s character changed for better and for worse, for better because she learned many things she didn’t knew before, as she was only 13 years old.', 'Juliet really changed with County Paris, at the beginning she was very obedient and polite, but when she met Romeo, she started to tell the truth about him, which she didn’t really love him. “… he shall not make me a joyful bride… ” This shows that Juliet’s feelings about marrying Paris will not make her happy.

In this act Juliet feels paranoia, she is confused and she is in a state of terror. Juliet’s character changed for better and for worse, for better because she learned many things she didn’t knew before, as she was only 13 years old. Juliet learned how to take important decisions without having to rely on someone. We can see this happen when she takes the potion and she secretly marries Romeo. And she also changed for worse because at the end she killed herself, but at least she died happy and killed herself because she rather not live that live without those that she loves. As the play progresses, Juliet makes a number of important decisions. She falls in love, gets married, and finally kills herself.', 'The love she experiences with Romeo begins to change her. After Juliet meets Romeo, and marries him, many of her opinions and interests begin to change. Juliet is now fuller of love. This shows us how Juliet changed her opinion about love; at the beginning of the play Juliet seems to love anyone her mother wants to. Juliet’s character is the one that changes the most in the play; she changes from being an innocent and obedient girl to a disobedient and independent young woman. In Act 1 Scene 3 we can see how Juliet is with her parents and her obedience toward them, Juliet says that she will love, but only if it pleases her parents. “I’ll look to like, if looking liking move; but no more deep will I endart mine eye than your consent gives strength to make it fly. ”', ""I'll look to like, if looking liking move,\nBut no more deep will I endart mine eye\nThan your consent gives strength to make it fly. ( 1.iii.99-101)\nAt this point, Juliet’s attitude towards marriage is about duty and obedience to her parents. The concept of love doesn’t even enter into the equation. That changes when Romeo enters the picture. Suddenly, Juliet’s heart is involved. The ensuing romance is heady, intense, passionate, and full of angst. The forbidden aspect of the whole affair gives it a titillating thrill that tosses it from a summer flirtation up to a romance of epic proportions. At the end of scene 5, Juliet is convinced that she is in love with a young lad she’d met only that night, a lad who is not only not Paris, but who is also the only son of her father’s greatest enemy. Although it wouldn’t be fair to downplay Romeo’s charm and physical attributes, I would say that circumstances have as much to do with Juliet’s feelings as any “love at first sight” chemistry do. Juliet is about to be pushed into a monumental change in her life that she is not sure she wants, and is ripe for rebellion in the matter."", 'This change in Juliet prompts the first significant change in the women’s relationship. Juliet enlists the Nurse’s help in arranging her rendezvous with her beloved, which will result in their marriage. Juliet believes that her request is justified, but she is asking the Nurse to risk losing her job. Nevertheless, the Nurse places her loyalty to her young charge over her obedience to Juliet’s parents. The second change occurs after Juliet marries Romeo but keeps the news a secret. This constitutes a break with the Nurse, whom Juliet now scorns as a “wicked fiend.” As the families’ feud turns bloody, Romeo is banished, and her father insists that she must marry Paris right away. The Nurse sees this as a much more sensible option than pursuing a relationship with a Montague. Juliet flies into a panic and insults her. The justification is doubtful, as she is mainly reacting out of anger.']";Juliet's feelings about marriage change dramatically due to her deepening relationship with Romeo, which sharply contrasts with her initial feelings toward marriage as a duty to her parents. Initially, Juliet is compliant and obeys her parents' wishes, viewing marriage as an obligation rather than a matter of love or personal choice, as demonstrated in her early conversations. However, after meeting and falling in love with Romeo, she experiences a transformative love that compels her to defy her family, engage in a secret marriage, and ultimately take drastic actions like faking her own death to avoid marrying Paris, whom she does not love. These changes reflect Juliet's shift from obedience and duty to passionate love and personal agency.;['Meeting Romeo transforms her perspective on marriage.', 'Forced marriage to Paris fuels rebellion.', 'She prioritizes passionate love over duty.', 'Forbidden love makes her defy family expectations.', 'Love and self-determination outweigh societal pressures.', 'Initial view of marriage as parental obligation.', 'Conflict between duty and desire shapes her choices.', 'Romeo’s banishment intensifies her conflict.', 'She seeks agency and control over her life.', 'Fear of a loveless marriage drives her actions.', 'Juliet matures from naiveté to passionate defiance.'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'support'];1.0

What Makes the Marines Different\nWhile members of every service branch take pride in their jobs, Marines put more emphasis on the pride of service and fulfillment of mission than any of the other nonelite services. Partly this begins with the nature of Marine recruitment appeals: the Marines attract a different population. While being too gung-ho can be a criticism in other service branches, it's nearly a requirement for joining the Marines. Marine Boot Camp, the required basic training that every new Marine goes through, is notoriously tougher than basic training in the other services. The Marine Corps three largest basic training camps have significantly higher broken bone rates than the other services. Marine Corps death rates over a 13-year period commencing in 1980 are also highest among the services and highest among the youngest Marines, 17-to-24-years-old.

One reason is the phenomenon of peripheral vision, where even when not directly focusing on others, our brain still processes the presence and heat of people around us, prompting a feeling of being watched. Additionally, anxiety and the fear of judgment can heighten sensitivity, leading individuals to misinterpret casual glances as focused observation, causing them to feel monitored even when others are not paying them any attention.

The reasons why humans castrate one another vary from punishment to atonement to self-discipline to elimination of rivals. The history of castration might make you uncomfortable, but it wasn\'t always intended to be a bad thing. Sure, surgical castration before modern advances in medicine was extremely painful, but the end results could mean political advancement or religious salvation. At the same time, however, you could have been forced into a singing career to support your family or punished for a crime. These facts about castration throughout history are both disturbing and interesting. Whether it was accidental or self-inflicted, people who were castrated play fascinating roles across a number of distinct cultures and time periods.

The Vatican employed castrati in the Papal choir and recruited them in droves after women were prohibited from being onstage by Pope Innocent XI in 1686.', 'Castration and blinding were set as punishments for treason by William the Conqueror when he invaded England in 1066, a tradition continued by Anglo-Norman and Southern Norman leaders alike. Castration was practiced elsewhere in medieval Europe, usually for sexual offenses. The Normans, however, used it as a way to deprive men of their masculinity, social identity, and power. Photo: Unknown / Wikimedia Commons / Public Domain\nEarly Christians Castrated Themselves To Prove Their Devotion\nDuring the first three centuries of Christian expansion, devotees castrated themselves to prove their dedication to the faith, mostly due to one mention of the practice in the New Testament. Matthew 19:12 reads: For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others - and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it. Many Christians took it literally. Early church writer Origen (185-251 CE) castrated himself , and other Christians followed suit.', 'Castration - BME Encyclopedia\nCastration\nCastration is the removal or destruction of one or both testicles.

Most voluntary castrations fall into two categories. The first is those who are castrated as a result of a sexual fantasy, who find the idea arousing, and who plan on continuing to engage in sexual activity post-castration. The second are those who desire castration to put an end to that side of themselves, and plan to remain celibate after their testicles have been removed. Traditionally, the medical community has believed that both groups of people are suffering from mental illness, but recently that idea has begun to change. One eunuch explains,\n""I\'ve been to see a local psychiatrist, by the way, just to settle my own curiosity about whether I\'m tightly wrapped or not, and he thinks I\'m just fine, except for this one strange but not uncommon fixation. This seems to be the case with most eunuchs I know, that they are all great guys and mostly very intelligent, successful, artistic, sports-minded and fun-loving but have this strange fixation. Each, by the way, has his own personal reasons for getting castrated (neutered, nutted, de-balled, and other terms we use with each other) and no two of these reasons are the same for any two eunuchs, except for the one about feeling out of control (being fanatical about having sex all the time without the ability to control one\'s sexual activities).', 'Chemical castration is achieved by administering hormones. Why is castration performed? Castration is most commonly performed to treat cancer or reduce the almost certain risk of cancer. The testes produce the male hormone testosterone, which stimulates growth of some cancerous tumors. Ã‚Â For example, a man with testicular cancer requires orchiectomy or chemical castration to prolong life. A boy with undescended testicles (retained in his abdomen instead of moving down into his scrotum)Ã‚Â is at risk of developing cancer if they are left in place. Other reasons castration is performed include to: Stanch bleeding or remove dead tissue when the testicles have been traumatized by force, sports, radiation, workplace chemical exposure, or cancer chemotherapy\nRemove a serious infection, such as gangrene or Ã¯Â¬â€šesh-eating disease (necrotizing fasciitis)\nTreat testicular torsion\nCorrect orchitis or infarct, complications that can occur 2 or 3 days after an inguinal hernia repair\nTreat a rare form of tuberculosis\nTreat infarction of the testicles from a rare vascular condition, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)\nMake a hermaphrodite child, who has ambiguous sex organs, distinctly female\nAllow the female hormones given to a male-to-female transsexual to work more quickly, or as a cheaper alternative to expensive, difÃ¯Â¬Â\x81cult vaginoplasty\nOffer a voluntary, rehabilitative alternative to long-term incarceration for repeat sex offenders who want help to control their urges\nFollow religious, social and wartime practices\nWhat are the statistics?

One in every 9 Australian men will develop prostate cancer.', 'It may have arisen in the Neolithic period in response to animal husbandry, rising populations and population specialisation. Castration was frequently used for religious or social reasons in certain cultures in Europe, South Asia, Africa, and East Asia. After battles, winners sometimes castrated their captives or the corpses of the defeated to symbolize their victory and seize their ""power"". Castrated men — eunuchs – were often admitted to special social classes and were used particularly to staff bureaucracies and palace households: in particular, the harem. Castration also figured in a number of religious castration cults. Other religions, such as Judaism, were strongly opposed to the practice. The Leviticus Holiness code, for example, specifically excludes eunuchs or any males with defective genitals from the priesthood, just as castrated animals are excluded from sacrifice . Eunuchs in China had been known to usurp power in many eras of Chinese history, most notably in the Later Han, late Tang and late Ming dynasties.

Primarily, it has been used as a form of punishment or as a means to deprive an individual of certain social and political powers. Additionally, castration has served religious or social purposes, such as in certain Christian contexts where individuals castrated themselves to prove their devotion, or in cultures where castrated men, known as eunuchs, held special roles within royal courts or bureaucracies.

But if you were the only person that disagreed with all your friends, would you still state your opinion? I bet most of you said that you would. However, research doesn’t back this up. In fact, it suggests the opposite. If someone thinks they’re in the minority, they are less likely to voice their opinion. However, if they believe the majority agrees with them, they’ll be much more willing to speak out. This is the Spiral of Silence Theory. So why don’t we speak out if we are the lone voice?

People may express their opinions or withhold their opinions due to the fear of exclusion or unpopularity. Shared social norms and beliefs create a sense of belonging, but they can also create a suppression of expression in order to comply or belong. People may adjust their beliefs or opinions to go along with the majority attitude. There are different factors that contribute to self-censorship, such as gender, age, education, political interests, and media exposure. For some, the reason for their change in beliefs and opinions is rooted in fear of isolation and exclusion. For these people, the expression of their own beliefs is less important than the fear of negative reactions of others to the expression of those beliefs. According to the survey on self-censorship in Germany, conducted from May 3–16, 2019 by Institut für Demoskopie Allensbach for the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), 59% of respondents said they can express their views among friends, but only 18% believe the same is possible in public.', 'If someone thinks they’re in the minority, they are less likely to voice their opinion.

Not being able to express emotion can mean you’re often stone-faced when others are crying, or you have very little facial expressions so people are afraid to approach you.

Low self-esteem is reinforced in a vicious circle of passive response and reduced self-confidence. See or pages on Building Confidence and Self-Esteem for more information. Roles\nCertain roles are associated with non-assertive behaviour, for example low status work roles or the traditional role of women. Stereotypically, women are seen as passive, while men are expected to be more aggressive. There can be great pressure on people to conform to the roles that are placed upon them.

The very first time that DNA evidence was used in a murder, as I recall, was in 1987–1988, in Great Britain. Remember: Jack the Ripper murdered at least five people in 1888, and he definitely meets today’s definitions of the “serial killer.” Until the 1970s, we just had no specific term, so we called him a killer.

We can often express an idea in a single sentence using figurative language, but it would take a full paragraph to communicate that same idea in literal terms. We often use figurative language in imagery (sensory details), making our language more sensuous and visceral.

Figurative language is also useful in explaining an abstract concept by comparing it to something else that readers can better relate to. It can transform the seemingly ordinary into something significant. This is why authors of all genres employ figures of speech so abundantly.

However, when any sector of a nation’s industry is threatened by foreign imports, voluminous concerns are raised. This is perhaps doubly the case with regard to inherently cultural products. Not only do foreign nations worry about their own domestic entertainment industries from an economic standpoint, but they also worry about the effects on their culture. For many citizens of other countries, American films and televisions shows are not just another commodity. “Washington’s crusade for free trade is often seen abroad as a Trojan horse for companies, such as Walt Disney Co. and Cable News Network, that would dominate foreign lifestyles and values.

Economic Effect\nThe spread of American pop culture throughout the world, through movies, television shows, popular music and other cultural forms, earns billions of dollars for producers and artists. A vast number of people, from movie studio cleaners to top Hollywood producers, are employed thanks to the spread of American pop culture. All these people are taxed, which brings revenue into the public purse to pay for education, healthcare, road building, and other public spending programs. Unifying Effect\nFew people will be unaware of Elvis, Bob Dylan, or Madonna. Likewise, American television programs -- from ""I Love Lucy"" to ""Cheers"" to ""Friends"" to ""Desperate Housewives"" to ""Glee"" -- have captured the attention of much of the world. In the sense that it provides common cultural experiences for a global audience, American pop culture has a unifying effect. This does not necessarily imply that all American pop culture is meritorious, simply that it brings together a wide, varied and appreciative audience.', 'The entertainment that the U.S. exports--especially now, during the U.S. government\'s ""war on terrorism""--often tries to feed people a line about ""American values"" of ""democracy"" and ""freedom."" But the U.S. entertainment industry has plenty of other rotten ideas to offer--from the sexism and corporate self-centeredness of TV\'s Ally McBeal to the anti-Arab stereotypes of movies like The Mummy. In his book Jihad vs. McWorld, journalist Benjamin Barber describes ""McWorld"" as ""a busy portrait of onrushing economic, technological, and ecological forces that demand integration and uniformity and that mesmerize peoples everywhere with fast music, fast computers and fast food--MTV, Macintosh, and McDonald\'s--pressing nations into one homogenous global theme park."" You could easily reach the conclusion from this argument that the process of globalization has meant that U.S. culture is destroying ""weaker"" national cultures--and has to be stopped. But there are problems with this view. First, the idea that people in poor nations are ""mesmerized"" by a flashy, technologically advanced culture is condescending. Secondly, this attitude can lead to the conclusion that ""weaker"" national cultures are always ""good""--while all of American culture is ""bad."" Marxism provides a different way of looking at the question. Culture can be defined broadly as all of people\'s different social practices--what they do for a living, their religions, the way that women are viewed, languages. There\'s also a narrow meaning of culture, which refers to art, music and literature.']";The export of U.S. culture, predominantly through movies, TV shows, and music, arguably does more good than harm, largely due to its economic and unifying effects. Economically, the global dissemination of American pop culture supports a vast number of jobs within the U.S. and generates significant tax revenue that contributes to public services like education and healthcare. Additionally, American pop culture, shared globally through various media forms, promotes a sense of unity by providing common cultural experiences to a diverse international audience, fostering a broader mutual understanding and appreciation across different societies. This cultural outreach illustrates the positive dimensions of U.S. cultural exportation despite criticisms of cultural homogenization and the imposition of American values.;['Spreads democratic ideals', 'Promotes intercultural understanding', 'Enhances cultural exchanges', 'Economic benefits for US businesses', 'Creates jobs, boosts wages', 'Cultural diplomacy fosters peace and stability', 'Strengthens soft power', 'Improved global communication', 'Greater variety of goods, entertainment', 'Exposure to diverse perspectives', 'Fosters international relationships', 'Increased tourism', 'Global access to information', 'Lower prices for consumers', 'More product choices', 'Cultural exchange fosters cooperation', 'American pop culture is globally popular', 'Indigenization adapts imported culture', 'Globalization creates jobs in the US', 'Higher productivity, higher standard of living', 'Challenges authoritarian regimes', 'Inspires social change', 'Improves global understanding', 'Reduces cultural isolation', 'Stimulates innovation', 'Promotes creativity'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay'];['not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.36363636363636365

We forgo some of our time when we wait in line for free popcorn or to enter a museum on a free-entrance day. We could have been doing something else at that time. Ultimately, he demonstrates how such a simple concept can be used to drive business and social policy. For example, to reduce health cost, companies could offer free regular checks. Employees would be more willing to get them at zero cost rather than paying some amount of money. Ariely recommends the consideration of the net benefits of the choices we make regarding both preference and money.', 'When the price is set to free, people take things they don’t need and forego better deals because they think ‘free’ comes at no cost. Free is alluring because people are afraid of loss even when the free item leads to increased opportunity costs. “When we pay—regardless of the amount of money—we feel some psychological pain, which social scientists call the “pain of paying.” This is the unpleasantness associated with giving up our hard-earned cash, regardless of the circumstances.” For example: When offered a choice between a free $10 Amazon gift card and $20 gift certificate for $7, approximately 70% of people choose the free $10 Amazon gift card even though $20 gift card for $7 is the better deal.

Stuff is an extremely illiquid asset. Unless you have some plan for selling that valuable thing you got so cheaply, what difference does it make what it\'s ""worth?"" The only way you\'re ever going to extract any value from it is to use it. And if you don\'t have any immediate use for it, you probably never will. Companies that sell stuff have spent huge sums training us to think stuff is still valuable. But it would be closer to the truth to treat stuff as worthless.', 'Scarcity forces trade-off thinking.

Special Considerations\nA decline in liquidity in the JGB market has been observed in recent years due to the aggressive monetary actions of the central bank—The Bank of Japan (BoJ). Since 2013, the Bank of Japan has been buying up billions of dollars of Japanese government bonds, flooding the economy with cash in an effort to propel the country’s low annual inflation rate toward its 2% target by keeping long-term interest rates at around 0%. To maintain the yield on 10-year JGBs at zero, a rise in the yield of these bonds triggers a buy action from the BoJ.\nAs of 2019, the central bank owns over 40% of Japanese government bonds. There is an inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices, which are dictated by supply and demand in the markets. Heavy buying of JGBs increases demand for the bonds, which leads to an increase in the price of the bonds. The price increase forces down the bond yield, an essential element of the central bank’s ultra-loose yield curve control (YCC) policy, which was designed to help increase the profits that Japanese banks could earn from lending money.

In other words, a higher yield would drive renewed demand for bonds, moderating the impact of any sell-off. Could the U.S. bond market eventually collapse as many are predicting? Possibly, but not likely if the post-crisis experience in Japan, which has been very similar to ours thus far, is any indication that rates can remain low—for far longer than investors are expecting. Longer-Term Data Shows the Rarity of Major Sell-Offs\nA look further back shows that the downside in Treasuries has been relatively limited.

Features Questions?""]";The Japanese bond market has been experiencing a decline in liquidity and dropping yields since 2010 for a few key reasons. First, the Bank of Japan's aggressive monetary policies, including the implementation of yield curve control in 2016, have involved purchasing large amounts of government bonds, aiming to keep the yield of 10-year Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) at around 0%. This heavy buying increases the price of the bonds, subsequently lowering their yield as part of efforts to stimulate economic growth by encouraging lending and spending. Additionally, these policies are a response to decades of low inflation rates and economic stagnation, following Japan's financial crisis in the 1990s which led to prolonged deflation and slow growth. The central bank's strategy keeps long-term interest rates low to manage economic recovery, influencing the overall dynamics of the bond market.;"['High debt-to-GDP ratio', 'Stagnant economic growth', 'Aging population', 'Shrinking tax base', 'BoJ’s massive JGB purchases', 'Unattractive bond yields', 'Increased government debt', 'Negative interest rates', 'Ultra-loose monetary policy', ""Abenomics' limited success"", 'Population decline reduces debt buyers', 'Liquidity trap', 'Global economic uncertainty', 'Deflationary pressures', 'Reduced investor demand']";['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital'];['not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'partial_support'];0.38461538461538464

E-mail: ku.ca.notos@dhml\nParasitic nematodes infect many species of animals throughout the phyla, including humans. Moreover, nematodes that parasitise plants are a global problem for agriculture. As such, these nematodes place a major burden on human health, on livestock production, on the welfare of companion animals and on crop production. In the 21 st century there are two major challenges posed by the wide-spread prevalence of parasitic nematodes. First, many anthelmintic drugs are losing their effectiveness because nematode strains with resistance are emerging. Second, serious concerns regarding the environmental impact of the nematicides used for crop protection have prompted legislation to remove them from use, leaving agriculture at increased risk from nematode pests. There is clearly a need for a concerted effort to address these challenges. Over the last few decades the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has provided the opportunity to use molecular genetic techniques for mode of action studies for anthelmintics and nematicides.', 'In the 21 st century there are two major challenges posed by the wide-spread prevalence of parasitic nematodes.

Over the last few decades the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has provided the opportunity to use molecular genetic techniques for mode of action studies for anthelmintics and nematicides. These approaches continue to be of considerable value. Less fruitful so far, but nonetheless potentially very useful, has been the direct use of C. elegans for anthelmintic and nematicide discovery programmes. Here we provide an introduction to the use of C. elegans as a ‘model’ parasitic nematode, briefly review the study of nematode control using C. elegans and highlight approaches that have been of particular value with a view to facilitating wider-use of C. elegans as a platform for anthelmintic and nematicide discovery and development. Go to: 1.', 'Aldicarb is a cholinesterase inhibitor, which prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synapse. In case of severe poisoning, the victim dies of respiratory failure. It is no longer authorised for use in the EU and, in August 2010, Bayer CropScience announced that it planned to discontinue aldicarb by 2014. Human health safety and environmental concerns have resulted in the widespread deregistration of several other agronomically important nematicides. Prior to 1985, the persistent halocarbon DBCP was a widely used nematicide and soil fumigant. However, it was banned from use after being linked to sterility among male workers; the Dow Chemical company was subsequently found liable for more than $600 million in damages. Several natural nematicides are known. An environmentally benign garlic -derived polysulfide product is approved for use in the European Union (under Annex 1 of 91/414) and the UK as a nematicide. Another common natural nematicide is obtained from neem cake, the residue obtained after cold-pressing the fruit and kernels of the neem tree.', 'This has resulted in restrictions on use and sometimes withdrawal from the market. It seems that the age of the traditional fumigants and nematicides has passed, and the opportunity for managing nematodes with synthetic chemicals with broad biocidal activity is declining. The development of new classes of nematicides with novel activity, that are effective when used in soil or applied directly to crops and are environmentally benign and specific to target pests, is perhaps an idealistic hope. Such compounds will, by definition, require considerable research effort, and if they are specific only to certain nematodes are unlikely to be considered an economic proposition for the traditional agrochemical company. Chemical control of nematodes\nThe demand\nThe elimination of nematodes from some crops is essential for certain export requirements, particularly of high-value horticultural products. Chemical treatment with fumigants or nematicides may be the only technique available, and from the plant quarantine standpoint it is important that their use is retained. The use of chemicals in protected cropping may still be preferable to other techniques such as steam treatment for economic and practical reasons. The use of soil-less growing media in some north European countries has resulted in a decreased demand for chemical treatments. In southern Europe, the Mediterranean region and North Africa, many horticultural and salad crops are grown in soil under polythene and soil treatment with methyl bromide, dazomet or non-fumigant nematicides is widely practised. The cost of such treatments may be as much as US$500 per hectare per year and can only be justified if the crops are of high market value.', 'In different countries, different ranges of fumigants (e.g. methyl bromide and dichloropropene), precursors of fumigants (e.g. dazomet) and nonvolatile nematicides (in granular form such as aldicarb) are still authorized for use but the list is becoming more and more restricted because of the negative environmental impact of the chemicals. Methylbromide, for example, which has a remarkably wide-spectrum activity (including weeds, soil fungi, nematodes and insects), will be banned in all countries of the European Union in 2005. Nematicides protect young plantlets during the first stages of their development and allow their satisfactory installation and subsequent productivity. None the less, none of the nematicides can eradicate nematodes from the soil because individuals can usually survive in deeper levels where they can escape chemical diffusion; reinfestation of the plants will inevitably occur after a few months or years. It is absolutely necessary that preplanting chemical treatments, which act only against nematode stages surviving in the bare soil, are combined with the use of nematode-free nursery plants.

But in the long run, similar challenges to other pesticides have been met with the development of superior compounds and innovative technologies.']";Over the past two to three decades, the loss of nematicides can be primarily attributed to two key challenges. Firstly, many anthelmintic drugs, including nematicides, are becoming less effective as resistance among nematode strains increases. Secondly, there are growing concerns regarding the environmental impact of these chemicals, which have led to legislative actions to remove many nematicides from use. Together, these factors have significantly reduced the available chemical controls for managing nematode pests in agriculture.;['Government regulations and stricter registration requirements.', 'Increasing pest resistance shortened market lives.', 'High mammalian toxicity restricts use.', 'Environmental concerns prompted legislation.', 'Groundwater contamination risks.', 'Economic factors limit new nematicide development.', 'Broad-spectrum toxicity of many nematicides.', 'Concerns about product liability discouraged new product introductions.', 'Resistance development in nematodes.'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital'];['support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support'];0.5714285714285714

The importance of songs, dance and story telling in indigenous societies lead us to believe that imagination plays an invaluable role in the creation and representation of indigenous knowledge systems. Imagination can be used to make sense of the world, to organise knowledge about the natural world and to explain reasons for our existence. \u200bInterestingly, what is considered imagination to some people, may well be reality to others. For example, to atheists, religion is a mere product of human imagination. Yet, even if you feel that religion represents reality and truth, you will have to resort to imagination to grasp the finesses which religious knowledge systems have to offer. Morality plays an important role within religion and to gain knowledge in the field of ethics, we need imagination. After all, to empathise you need to be able to imagine. We also need imagination to interpret religious texts, to make religious knowledge our own and to conceptualise the bigger things in life such as death, the reason we live, and our place in the universe. In this context, it is worth exploring the role of metaphor and the figurative use of language within religious texts, creation stories and oral traditions.', 'Imagination also allows us the very human emotion of empathy as we can literally imagine another person’s life experience without ever having actually experienced any of it. In the words of JK Rowling…\n“Imagination is not only the uniquely human capacity to envision that which is not, and, therefore, the foundation of all invention and innovation. In its arguably most transformative and revelatory capacity, it is the power that enables us to empathize with humans whose experiences we have never shared.” The evolution of imagination\nOur early ancestors, the hominids showed basic levels of imagination in their tool making abilities, cooperative hunting skills and social interaction and colonization. It would appear that their level of imagination was limited though, perhaps with respect to their brain size and their compartmentalized thinking. As modern humans evolved scientists have reported an increase in brain size, advances in technical skills and creativity and a development in social complexities. Farming, sophisticated tool making, complex language development, the performance of rituals and the development of art and crafting all required a complex development of thought and mental interaction… Imagination! A more developed neural network within the brain, connecting the different areas of brain function, must have had some part to play in all this. The majority of these changes evolved between 500,000 and 200,000 years ago, to the eventual emergence of the modern human. The importance of imagination in our development and learning\nAs a parent this is the part that I am most interested in.', 'The findings from this study suggest that imagination uses a large portion of the human brain, creating an interconnecting network of activity across many different areas. Imagination really does light up our brains! Is imagination unique to humans? It would appear that imagination (at least in its complete form) is a uniquely human experience. It has allowed us to modify and develop our surroundings and to create and invent new ideas, new structures, new technologies.

One’s imagination is highly stimulated from stories, fairy tales and both fictional and factual events that give one the opportunity to visualize and envision things that can only be formed and found within the mind. Imagination is one complex feature that only the mind can fully fathom and no other being can fully execute except the human being. As one vital feature of the brain’s function, imagination is an important element that needs to be developed and adequately nourished. Imagination is not a limited concept of only forming images of the mind but it also involves all the other senses and feelings. Therefore, imagination is important because it allows one to have strong creative abilities. More so, the use of imagination helps in training one’s senses, putting them in coordination with one another. Imagination keeps the senses intact to adequately function as it serves as one effective tool in recreating and innovating one’s world and life. Thus, imagination is one important element that plays a major role and value in each one’s life. More so, imagination gives us the freedom to think what one wants to think and to associate with any feeling that one wants to associate it with.', ""The ideologies as well as the nightmare scenarios which some political leaders present us, clearly draw on imagination (whether or not these visions are based on reality). They shape what we know and how we live our lives. The apocalyptic futures of religious text draw on imagination as well. Imagination also plays an important role in understanding others, as illustrated before through the example of empathy. Imagination is more than conjuring a mental picture of something. It also means 'imagining that'. The latter partly explains the political role of imagination in sociological advances as well as socio-political ideals and paradigm shifts. The importance of imagination as a way of knowing is highlighted by the mental conditions which distort one's imagination, such as schizophrenia and severe autism. Finally, imagination plays a substantial role in theory creation and the invention of models. The latter could lead to some interesting knowledge questions, as questions on models, prediction and theory are central within the TOK course.""]";Human imagination is crucial for anthropology because it is integral to understanding and interpreting the diverse ways in which different cultures conceptualize the world. It facilitates the study of indigenous knowledge systems, where imagination aids in the transmission of knowledge through folklore, rituals, and art. Furthermore, imagination is essential for empathizing with and understanding the experiences and values of various cultures, thereby allowing anthropologists to comprehensively document human diversity and complexity.

This has come with many problems. Many people complain about the negative environmental impacts of large-scale cultivation, such as soil salinization, the loss of ecosystems as they are turned into arable land, air pollution from burning fossil fuels for farm machinery and from the vast numbers of livestock, land pollution from fertilizers, and reduction of diverse biomasses to a select few species of flora and fauna that the industry has deemed profitable. As interest in biofuels continues to grow, expect the price of crops used to produce these fuels to increase as well. Finally, there are concerns about increased usage of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). GMOs pose a threat to local crops, both by the risk of farmers not using local crops anymore and by potential cross pollination with these crops, and can give too much pricing control to the creator of these seeds due to their patent protection. GMOs also allow for cheaper agricultural products, however; which is a huge issue with commodity prices on the rise recently. This increase in commodity prices impacts the agricultural industry in two ways:', 'Despite that, the underlying issues of agriculture faced globally are along the same lines. Here are the major issues and solutions to agricultural problems: Not Enough Agricultural Land\nThis problem of agriculture is faced by people all over the world. The steady industrial growth coupled with the ever-increasing urbanization is leaving little to no room for any agricultural land. Deforestation and concrete jungles are taking up maximum area leaving little to no room for farming. The land that already exists cannot be used continuously year after year since it needs a couple of years to breathe. In addition to that, farmers prefer growing money-making crops like indigo in comparison to grains and other eatables. Until the issue of enough availability of agricultural land exists, one cannot expect significant improvement in this sector. Limited Resources\nThis is another problem we face in agriculture. Even if one wants to go all out with their agricultural techniques, this cannot be made possible.', 'Unsustainable Agricultural Practices\nAccording to the FAO, agricultural production is a huge driver of climate change, producing one-fifth of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. [ 12] Intensive farming methods use fertilizers and pesticides that contaminate streams and rivers that can create downstream “dead zones,” and deforestation for agricultural use accounts for an estimated 10-11% of global GHG emissions. [ 13], [14] Big agribusinesses utilize poor agricultural practices to cut production costs, and, due to these practices, 5-10 million hectares of arable farmland become unusable every year, with an additional 0.3-1.5 million becoming unproductive as a result of salinization and water logging. [ 15] To protect our environment, our health, and our food, we must implement climate-sensitive production methods such as reduced tillage, crop rotations, soil enrichment, the encouragement of natural pest predators, and the incorporation of agroforestry. [ 16], [17] Agriculture can be shifted to degraded lands, rather than clearing new lands, with a focus on practices that boost productivity and enhance resilience. [ 18] Furthermore, there is a global need to support more small-scale, less mechanically intensive, and more organic practices in order to preserve our productive agricultural land and prevent climate change. 4. Lack of Farmer and Workers’ Rights\nAccording to the International Food Policy Research Institute’s Global Food Policy Report (GFPR), smallholder farmers that farm less than 2 hectares of land make up the majority of agricultural producers for the world, but also make up half of the world’s poor and hungry population. [ 19] These smaller farmers are increasingly unable to compete in an agricultural market dominated by big agribusinesses. Smallholders have a lack of access to the proper assets, such as tractors and fertilizers, and small farmers that are able to stay in business earn less due to the immense surpluses produced by industrial agricultural companies or are subject to these companies’ control.', 'Lack of Financial Support\nIn almost all developing countries, agriculture is the main occupation of a majority of people. However, it is not given its due importance. Farmers in such countries are hardly given any financial benefits, and the schemes designed in their favor rarely make it to them.

The masses don’t realize how difficult it is to fund a farming project without adequate financial backup form the government. Investing in good quality seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, and irrigation facilities all need to be funded and only then can we expect considerable growth in the agricultural sector.

These challenges include soil salinization, loss of ecosystems, air and land pollution from fossil fuels and fertilizers, and reduction of biodiversity due to favoring select profitable crops. Furthermore, the growth of biofuels and the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) present economic and ecological risks by potentially displacing local crops and giving disproportionate control to seed patent holders, further complicating the sustainability of agricultural practices.

Under the tutelage of Mazer Rackham, the legendary savior of humanity from the previous war, Ender and his trusted companions take on a grueling series of battles and emerge victorious each time, although the mounting pressure pushes Ender to the edge. The final battle takes place above a planet made by the simulator at command school. The fight is against an enemy with overwhelming numerical superiority.']";After the war, Ender is in danger primarily because of the political consequences of his actions and the presence of his brother, Peter, as a rising political power on Earth. Valentine, Ender's sister, recognizes the danger posed by Peter, who has gained considerable influence and could potentially harm Ender due to their complicated familial dynamics and Peter's ambition. To protect Ender from these political repercussions and from Peter's possible malintent, Valentine ensures that Ender cannot return to Earth and instead, travels with him to a colony on one of the now-abandoned Bugger worlds.

The main factors underlying the lingering decline in basic food commodity prices are “the generally ample agricultural supply conditions, a slowing global economy, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar,” the FAO noted.

Mixed harvests\nLooking ahead to commodity prices in 2016, the FAO said that there were mixed early prospects for 2016 harvests with potential disruption from erratic weather systems. In particular, the weather pattern known as El Niño was “sending mixed signals about the early prospects for cereal crops in 2016, especially in the Southern Hemisphere.” 2016 crop prospects have been “severely weakened” in Southern Africa, and a 25 percent cut in wheat production in South Africa now appears likely, the FAO said.

Global commodity prices fell 38% between June 2014 and February 2015. Demand and supply conditions led to lower price expectations for all nine of the World Bank\'s commodity price indices - an extremely rare occurrence. The commodity price shock in the second half of 2014 cannot be attributed to any single factor or defining event. It was caused by a host of industry-specific, macroeconomic and financial factors which came together to cause the simultaneous large drops across many different commodity classes. Amongst these, the transition of China\'s economy to more sustainable levels of growth and the shale-energy boom in the United States were the dominant demand-side and supply-side factors governing the downturn in global commodity prices. 2020\nOn April 20, 2020, WTI\'s May contract closed at -$37.63/barrel while the June contract closed at positive $20.43/barrel.

The Food Price Index, published by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), averaged 150.4 points in January, down 16 percent from a year earlier and registering its lowest level since April 2009. The trade-weighted index tracks international market prices for five key commodity groups -- major cereals, vegetable oils, dairy, meat and sugar – on a monthly basis. In January, the Sugar Price Index showed the largest declines having fallen 4.1 percent from December, its first drop in four months. The FAO said the drop was down to improved crop conditions in Brazil, the world’s leading sugar producer and exporter. The second largest declines were seen in the FAO’s Dairy Price Index which dropped by 3.0 percent in the same time period “on the back of large supplies, in both the EU and New Zealand, and torpid world import demand,” the FAO noted.

First, there is an ample supply of agricultural products, particularly noting large supplies from significant producers like the EU and New Zealand, which surpass current global demand. Second, a slowing global economy has reduced consumption rates, impacting demand for these commodities. Lastly, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar makes these commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies, thus decreasing international demand.

TermS\nEurocentrism\nThe practice of viewing the world from a European or generally Western perspective with an implied belief in the pre-eminence of Western culture. It may also be used to describe a view centered on the history or eminence of white people. The term was coined in the 1980s, referring to the notion of European exceptionalism and other Western equivalents, such as American exceptionalism. Bias in Historical Writing\nBias is an inclination or outlook to present or hold a partial perspective, often accompanied by a refusal to consider the possible merits of alternative points of view. Regardless of whether conscious or learned implicitly within cultural contexts, biases have been part of historical investigation since the ancient beginnings of the discipline.', 'The practice of viewing and presenting the world from a European or generally Western perspective, with an implied belief in the pre-eminence of Western culture, dominated among European historians who contrasted the progressively mechanized character of European culture with traditional hunting, farming and herding societies in many of the areas of the world being newly conquered and colonized. These included the Americas, Asia, Africa and, later, the Pacific and Australasia. Many European writers of this time construed the history of Europe as paradigmatic for the rest of the world. Other cultures were identified as having reached a stage that Europe itself had already passed: primitive hunter-gatherer, farming, early civilization, feudalism and modern liberal-capitalism. Only Europe was considered to have achieved the last stage. With this assumption, Europeans were also presented as racially superior, and European history as a discipline became essentially the history of the dominance of white peoples. However, even within the Eurocentric perspective, not all Europeans were equal; Western historians largely ignored aspects of history, such as class, gender, or ethnicity.

It was compiled by Henry Smith Williams, a medical doctor and author, as well as other authorities on history, and published in New York in 1902 by Encyclopædia Britannica and the Outlook Company. Bias in the Teaching of History\nThe biased approach to historical writing is present in the teaching of history as well. From the origins of national mass schooling systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority. Until today, in most countries history textbook are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism and promote the most favorable version of national history. In the United States, one of the most striking examples of this approach is the continuous narrative of the United States as a state established on the principles of personal liberty and democracy. Although aspects of U.S. history, such as slavery, genocide of American Indians, or disfranchisement of the large segments of the society for decades after the onset of the American statehood, are now taught in most (yet not all) American schools, they are presented as marginal in the larger narrative of liberty and democracy. In many countries, history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favorable light, although academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success. Interestingly, the 21st-century Germany attempts to be an example of how to remove nationalistic narratives from history education.']";The writing of history in Europe has often been biased towards positive depictions primarily due to the practice of promoting national sentiments through education. From the 19th century onwards, history textbooks have been used as tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, promoting narratives that cast the national history in the most favorable light.

Recognizing and understanding past genocides, such as those committed against Armenians, Jews during the Holocaust, and other groups, underscore the severe human cost and the deep societal scars they leave. Secondly, failures to prevent past genocides have resulted in the loss of millions of lives - genocides and other forms of mass murder in the 20th century claimed more lives than all international wars of that century combined.

Some even for shock value just to get into the forefront of the public eye. They see models with unrealistic body shapes and think that to be beautiful and successful they too have to be unhealthily thin. They don\'t know how many models are throwing up the only calories their bodies receive on a daily basis. They don\'t understand that celebrities that are dressing in body-hugging clothes and see-through tops are purposefully dressing that way because sex sells.

They aren\'t even getting the chance to figure out for themselves the stupidity of celebrities who spend a good sum of money walking in 9"" stilettos or shoes without heels all for the sake of publicity.

Generally accepted Western norms\nAppropriate modesty depends on context and place. For example, in single-sex public changing rooms, nudity is often acceptable. In Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as to how much body exposure is acceptable in public. In contemporary Western society, the extent to which a woman may expose cleavage depends on social, cultural and regional context. Women's swimsuits and bikinis commonly may reveal the tops and sides of the breasts, or they may be topless as is common on the beaches of French Riviera. Displaying cleavage is considered permissible in many settings, and is even a sign of elegance and sophistication on many formal social occasions, but it may be considered inappropriate in settings such as workplaces, churches and schools. Showing the nipples or areolae is almost always considered toplessness or partial nudity. However, in some circumstances partial breast exposure may be officially sanctioned in church, as in 2014 newly elected Pope Francis drew world-wide commentary when he encouraged mothers to breastfeed in church if their babies were hungry. In private homes, the standards of modesty apply selectively."", 'Contemporary families need to \nencourage the generation of today to embrace such valuable morals and to reject \nthe inferior behavior and ideology embraced by the corrupt celebrities.

First, celebrities often dress provocatively for publicity and shock value, seeking to capture the public's attention and remain relevant in the media. This is strategically done because sex sells and helps maintain their visibility and popularity. Additionally, societal norms and expectations have evolved, where showing skin has become associated with fashion statements and sometimes perceived sophistication, differing significantly from conservative dress codes of the past like those of the 1950s.

In particular, sex is generally much farther down on the list of motivations for female serial killers. In fact, sexual or sadistic motives are extremely rare among female serial murderers. Psychopathic traits and histories of childhood abuse are often found among the very few female serial killers who have sexual or sadistic motives. Unlike male serial killers who are frequently driven by sexual lust, female serial murderers tend to take a much more pragmatic approach to their killings. Female serial killers are much more likely than males to kill for profit or revenge , and, therefore, they are more likely to fall into the category of a hedonist comfort/gain killer than any other type. Unlike male serial killers who usually target unknown victims, females tend to kill men who are emotionally and physically closest to them—particularly husbands or lovers—and they generally kill to improve their lifestyle. However, victims of female serial killers are not confined to male husbands or lovers. An important psychological study of 86 female serial killers in the U.S. found that their victims also included children and the elderly (1).', 'It’s important to consider that media reports may be biased toward more sensationalistic murders, and any generalizations in the study’s findings are based on only several dozen people—both caveats that the researchers acknowledge. But that’s also inevitable. Documented serial killings are rare, even more so when they are perpetrated by women. Harrison thinks there are probably more female serial killers than have been recorded, or even caught. Just as society tends to underestimate women, it also tends to be dismissive of female serial killers, giving them silly nicknames like “Jolly Jane” or “The Giggling Grandma.” Media accounts focus on their looks. “ Society tends to believe that women can’t do such heinous things. Women are thought of as caregivers and kind,” she said. Men serial killers tend to follow their victims, often going from town to town, the research shows. They wait for the perfect time to attack, like a predator hunting for their prey.', ""It's true that there are far less female serial murderers than there are males (although percentage-wise, there are more female serial murderers (15 percent in comparison to 85 percent males) than there are one-time killers (90 percent men; 10 percent women). It's also true that you aren't as likely to see a woman torturing her victim or having sex with a dead corpse, the kinds of gory details that make headlines and sell movies. In fact, sex and pleasure are likely to be much farther down on the motivation list for female serial killers than men; we females tend to take a more pragmatic approach to killing people off. Female serial killers kill for profit and power. Most female serial killers work alone. And, they're good at it. In fact, if you accept the now-common definition of a serial murderer as someone who kills three or more persons, with time elapsing between homicidal events, females outperform their male counterparts. A 2011 study found that these lethal ladies operate under the radar;"", 'In reality, as opposed to fiction, serial killing is a rare crime, committed by few individuals of either sex. And among those few individuals, the number of women is negligible. Before Joanna Dennehy, Britain had produced only two examples of the ‘female serial killer’—Myra Hindley and Rosemary West—in the space of fifty years. The other way in which ‘the female serial killer’ is mythologized is through the stories which are told about her—stories about who she is, why she kills, and above all what her killing has to do with her femaleness. Male serial killers are also mythologized, but without the same obsessive focus on their gender. Whereas Joanna Dennehy inspired a slew of articles with titles like ‘Inside the mind of the female serial killer’, and ‘What makes a female serial killer tick?’, no one would call an article ‘Inside the mind of the male serial killer’. The serial killer is male by default: his maleness is both taken for granted and glossed over in the stories told to explain his behaviour.

One social psychologist from the University of Central Arkansas, Paul Nail, has a pretty interesting answer: “ Conservatism, apparently, helps to protect people against some of the natural difficulties of living. The fact is we don’t live in a completely safe world. Things can and do go wrong. But if I can impose this order on it by my worldview, I can keep my anxiety to a manageable level.”', 'This is what psychologists call a “negativity bias.” If you think about it, this makes sense. When attention is biased toward the negative, the result is an overly threat-conscious appraisal of one’s surroundings. To many conservatives, the world may look like a much scarier place.

In a Washington Post-ABC News poll released this week, 63 percent of participants—and 82 percent of Republicans—said mass shootings reflect problems in identifying and treating people with mental-health problems, while just 23 percent said they reflected inadequate gun-control laws. But mental-health advocates, individuals who suffer from mental-health issues, and the people who support them likely bristled at his remarks. In the United States, one in four adults, or approximately 61.5 million Americans, experiences some form of mental illness in a given year, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, a nonprofit advocacy group.

What is almost indisputable is that the changes in public policy that were implemented during the 1980s were sweeping and marked a \r\n\r\nturning point in American domestic policy. Faced with increasing competition from overseas, American business found it necessary to alter the social contract. This would require a realignment of the political economy so as to weaken labor unions and the social safety net. In Reagan, the Right found a spokesman capable of aligning conservatives, centrists, and working class whites. With this coalition, Reagan was able to bring about a number of reactionary changes in public policy (Alford, 1988). This paper provides an illustration of this co-optation by examining the policies regarding involuntary commitment of the mentally ill. The shifts in such policies were not the result of overt attempts at change, but rather part of an overall effort to\r\n\r\n realign the political economy to be more profitable for business.']";The passage suggests that many conservatives believe mental health issues are a significant factor in societal problems, such as mass shootings. According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll, a substantial majority of Republicans (82%) perceive mass shootings as reflecting problems in identifying and treating mental health issues rather than inadequate gun control. This view aligns with broader conservative approaches to mental health, which have historically included both advocacy for better conditions outside of institutional settings and policies that have affected the availability of treatment and resources for the mentally ill.

Why is Prostitution Illegal\nSupporters of prostitution argue that it is a “victimless crime,” as those involved are often two consenting adults. Lawmakers and the majority of the public see prostitution differently, however. Commonly, it is viewed as harmful to the individuals involved, and to society as a whole. Prostitution laws are aimed at preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, protecting minors who might become involved in, or forced into the sex trade, and to deter other crimes that are often committed in conjunction with prostitution. Many people also believe that prostitution exploits women. Real Life Prostitution Cases\nCases related to prostitution and the sex trade plague courts across the U.S. and around the globe. Judges stretch sentencing in their attempts to adequately punish those guilty of luring or forcing others into prostitution. Prostitution and Sex Trafficking of a Minor\nOn February 27, 2015, Chief U.S. District Judge, Fred Biery, broke down as he told the courtroom that the case of “physical and psychological theft of innocence of children” by four people convicted of trafficking minors as escorts was the most egregious case he had heard in his 21 years on the federal bench. In three separate trials of four defendants, prosecutors painted a picture of greed, addiction, and sex, promoted by modern technology, when they recruited underage girls into prostitution, advertising them over the Internet as escorts.', 'A ‘Victimless Crime’?,” wrote: “Prostitution is often described as a ‘victimless crime’, or a ‘consensual crime’, because in theory, no one present at the crime is unwilling. In reality, this is a myth. In reality, prostitution of women is a particularly lethal form of violence against women, and a violation of a woman’s most basic human rights. It is rarely the media-approved version of prostitution, a sexy and highly-paid adventure where business is conducted at upscale bars and in hotel rooms; though some sex workers do have that experience, most do not. For the vast majority of prostituted women, prostitution is the experience of being hunted, dominated, harassed, assaulted and battered. Sadly, the majority of girls enter prostitution before they have reached the age of consent. In other words, their first commercial sexual interactions are rape…\nAnother myth is that most women and girls choose to enter the sex industry.', 'And if prostitution were legal, the word ‘crime’ wouldn’t even appear in this paragraph…\nProstitution should be legalized and called something less derogatory, such as ‘Sex Worker’ or ‘Licensed Companions’…\nProstitution is, at its core, a simple transaction – a trade of money for a service. As long as all parties are of legal age and ability to consent, according to the laws of the land in which it occurs, since when is a simple transaction a crime?.” Nov. 4, 2016 - Wendy C. Garfinkle, MA, MFA\nPro\nCathy Young, Contributing Editor at Reason magazine and Reason.com, stated in her May 7, 2007 Reason.com article titled “Prostitutes and Politics”: “ [P]rostitution is perhaps the ultimate victimless crime: a consensual transaction in which both parties are supposedly committing a crime, and the person most likely to be charged—the one selling sex—is also the one most likely to be viewed as the victim…\nIt’s the criminalization of prostitution that does take actual victims…\nAs with other victimless crimes, the criminalization of prostitution creates a vast breeding ground for corruption, hypocrisy, and morally dubious law enforcement tactics.” May 7, 2007 - Cathy Young\nPro\nBilly J. Long, PhD, Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice at Ferrum College, stated in his Aug. 2012 article titled “Freedom for Women in the Sex Work Occupation: Twenty-Three Reasons Why Prostitution Should Be Legalized in America,” published in the International Journal of Humanities and Social Science: “For too long, many in the United States have considered sex work to be demeaning toward women. Women sex workers are typically viewed as ‘billiard balls’ helplessly propelled into prostitution and being degraded by their male customers. These hapless victims are viewed with pity while the evil male oppressor is castigated for stooping to the depths of depravity by paying for sex with cash.', 'Eventually, at the turn of the nineteenth century, the states began to enact criminal laws prohibiting prostitution, while Congress did the same. By 1971 every state other than Nevada had outlawed sex-for-sale. A Victimless Crime? Some have argued that prostitution is a “victimless crime”—at least when adults are concerned—in that it involves only consenting individuals. The majority view, however, is that commercial sex harms these individuals and, more importantly, society at large. The ban against prostitution is said to denounce the exploitation of sexual gratification. Prostitution laws are intended to protect public health and welfare (including the suppression of sexually transmitted diseases), protect minors who might otherwise become involved in the sex industry, thwart other associated forms of crime, and curb the incentive to exploit women. Typical Legal Approaches to Prostitution\nIn some states, prostitution is considered a form of disorderly conduct. In most the crime includes offering or agreeing to, or actually engaging in, a sexual act in exchange for money. Statutes typically describe the contemplated sexual activity vaguely.', 'The ban against prostitution is said to denounce the exploitation of sexual gratification.

In many states, the government must prove only that the prostitute offered or agreed to engage in sexual conduct for compensation, regardless of whether she or he intended to follow through on that offer or agreement. The only requirement is that the offer or agreement not be in jest. In some states, though, the prosecution must prove that the defendant specifically intended to engage in the sexual act in exchange for money.']";Prostitution is criminalized largely due to concerns about public health, social morality, and exploitation. Lawmakers and the majority of the public view prostitution as harmful to both the individuals involved and to society at large, leading to the implementation of laws that seek to protect public welfare.

In a purely competitive market, the intense competition forces producers to continually lower their prices to attract consumers, ultimately leading to minimal profits or even losses.

But while this has become a popular topic of discussion, few are willing to make the major lifestyle changes necessary to reverse it. The government of the country that is one of the biggest per-capita culprits (the United States) now at least acknowledges the reality of global climate change—but still refuses to face up to the problem. The energy platforms of major political candidates for leadership positions in the United States carefully ignore or minimize attention to this politically charged issue. And the same is true of the other major contributors to the problem, such as those companies that extract more and more fossil fuels from the earth yet run misleading advertising campaigns that claim that they really do care about the environment. Even worse, the melting of Arctic ice has given many countries the impetus to prospect for more fossil fuels in that pristine wilderness.

Honest, thoughtful dialogue will go a lot further toward educating the public and building trust with the scientific community than chest-thumping bravado or fear mongering. It is critical to build that trust, because the real threats to the future of humanity are not rogue scientists doing genetic engineering, but the everyday behaviors of billions of people.

Scientific racism employs anthropology (notably physical anthropology ), anthropometry, craniometry, and other disciplines or pseudo-disciplines, in proposing anthropological typologies supporting the classification of human populations into physically discrete human races, some of which might be asserted to be superior or inferior to others. Scientific racism was common during the period from the 1600s to the end of World War II. Since the second half of the 20th century, scientific racism has been criticized as obsolete and discredited, yet has persistently been used to support or validate racist world-views, based upon belief in the existence and significance of racial categories and a hierarchy of superior and inferior races. After the end of World War II, scientific racism in theory and action was formally denounced, especially in UNESCO \'s early antiracist statement "" The Race Question "" (1950): "" The biological fact of race and the myth of \'race\' should be distinguished. For all practical social purposes \'race\' is not so much a biological phenomenon as a social myth. The myth of \'race\' has created an enormous amount of human and social damage.

Why Are Nursing Homes Understaffed? There are few different reasons why more and more nursing homes are being understaffed. One of those reasons is cost. The labor costs for nursing homes are very high compared to other costs. Some nursing homes cannot afford to have as many registered nurses and certified nursing assistants as they need. Instead they just try to stretch their existing staff as much as they can. Take Our Survey, Get Answers\nThere are also situations were nursing facilities struggle to find and hold on to qualified medical professionals. Nursing home facilities are a difficult and high stress environment, and some nurses and nurse’s aides prefer to work in hospitals and other facilities. It is also very difficult for nursing homes in small towns and rural areas to find enough qualified people to fill all of their positions.', 'Why Does Understaffing Occur? Budget cuts, nurses reaching retirement age and a shortage of nurse faculty to prepare new nurses are just a few reasons for understaffing. Is There a Link Between Understaffing and Negative Patient Outcomes? Healthcare facilities that do not keep an adequate number of nurses on duty can jeopardize the safety of their patients. Overworked nurses may suffer from fatigue or burnout which can impair their ability to focus on tasks. This lack of focus can lead to medical errors, a lack of engagement and missed nursing care. Patients in understaffed facilities face an increased rate of in-hospital mortality, a higher risk of infection, a rise in postoperative complications, and a greater number of falls. How Does Understaffing Affect Nurses? When a healthcare facility is understaffed, the same amount of work falls to fewer nurses who typically end up working longer hours. Doing so with little to no relief can cause a breakdown in mental, emotional and physical health.', 'Nursing Home Understaffing - Neglect and Liability\nNursing Home Understaffing\nOne underlying cause of elder abuse and neglect that affects nursing homes all across the country is the issue of understaffing. When nursing facilities do not have enough staff to give each patient adequate attention, it leads to mistakes and neglect. At the same time, when staff is extremely overworked and stressed, there is a greater risk that they will commit abusive acts out of frustration. Understaffing is a serious issue that has plagued nursing homes for decades, and more than 90% of nursing homes are currently understaffed. Studies have proven that residents who live in understaffed nursing homes are at a greater risk of malnutrition, weight loss, bedsores, dehydration, infections, and pneumonia. Families of elderly patients are increasingly noticing this problem and are starting to hold nursing homes responsible for the abuses that occur as a result. Why Are Nursing Homes Understaffed? There are few different reasons why more and more nursing homes are being understaffed. One of those reasons is cost. The labor costs for nursing homes are very high compared to other costs.', 'One facility had eight residents to each caregiver on their best-staffed day. On their lowest-staffed day, this increased to 18 residents for every caregiver. When the ratio of residents to staff is off, caregivers are overwhelmed with responsibilities. They scramble to provide medication, meals and care to the residents who depend on them. Many residents need help getting dressed or using the bathroom. Without an aide on hand, these residents are left feeling helpless and neglected. When there is understaffing in nursing homes, essential tasks are neglected, such as: Adjusting residents to prevent bed sores\nChecking up on patients and noting changes in health\nKeeping residents clean to prevent infection\nPreventing dangerous falls by helping residents move around\nStaff members end up feeling stressed and upset by their lack of ability to provide quality care to their patients. As a result, they may become bitter, taking out their frustration on residents. This is where physical or verbal abuse becomes an issue.', 'A caregiver shortage forces staff to prioritize certain duties over others. This often means overlooking responsibilities like preventing infection, controlling accident hazards, maintaining sanitary conditions and improving resident well-being. Understaffing in nursing homes reduces the standard of care and puts residents at risk. On the other hand, studies show that a good ratio of staff to residents increases the quality of care and improves health among residents. Why Resident-to-Staff Ratio Is Important\nNursing homes are staffed on a ratio of residents to staff. Fewer residents to each staff member prevents the care team from becoming overwhelmed. Since Medicare does not require a minimum resident-to-staff ratio, many nursing homes have too few staff and more residents than they can care for. According to Federal data, most nursing homes have fewer staff than they report. Staffing ratios are widely inconsistent from day to day. On short-staffed days, staff often care for twice as many residents as usual.'];The FRA (presuming this refers to a similar care organization or nursing home) is likely understaffed due to several key reasons highlighted in the passage regarding nursing homes. Firstly, the high cost of labor significant compared to other expenses, making it financially challenging for facilities to maintain adequate staff levels. Additionally, there is a difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified medical professionals, especially in high-stress environments like nursing homes, and even more so in rural or small town facilities where the pool of qualified candidates is smaller. This combination of high labor costs and recruitment challenges leads to understaffing in such facilities.;['Budget cuts', 'High turnover', 'Difficulty recruiting', 'Increased workload', 'Low employee morale', 'Shortage of qualified staff', 'Insufficient resources', 'Slow hiring practices', 'Excessive stress', 'Unfilled positions', 'Poor management', 'Lack of career growth', 'Low pay', 'Safety concerns', 'Lack of interest', 'Legal issues', 'Inadequate training', 'Generational gap', 'Lengthy certification', 'Decreased volunteerism', 'Increased demand', 'Layoffs', 'Minimum staffing levels', 'Overtime costs'];['Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Vital', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Vital', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Okay'];['not_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support'];0.0

The modern administrative state, however, blurs the separation of powers and the system of checks and balances and has become an unaccountable fourth branch of government. The Progressive Era led to the creation and strengthening of agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration; the New Deal brought the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Federal Communications Commission; the 1970s heralded the Environmental Protection Agency; and more recently has come the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

One colleague is expressing her frustration at the current state of the regulations surrounding an area of business practice. She is blaming the President for not taking steps to ease the regulatory burden.', 'By the early part of this century, the ICC gained the power to fix rates. From the 1970s through 1995, however, Congress passed deregulatory measures, and the ICC was formally abolished in 1995, with its powers transferred to the Surface Transportation Board. Beginning with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914, Congress has created numerous other agencies, many of them familiar actors in American government. Today more than eighty-five federal agencies have jurisdiction to regulate some form of private activity. Most were created since 1930, and more than a third since 1960. A similar growth has occurred at the state level. Most states now have dozens of regulatory agencies, many of them overlapping in function with the federal bodies. Classification of Agencies\nIndependent agencies are different from federal executive departments and other executive agencies by their structural and functional characteristics. Most executive departments have a single director, administrator, or secretary appointed by the president of the United States. Independent agencies almost always have a commission or board consisting of five to seven members who share power over the agency.', ""In response, supporters of administrative agencies note that agencies are created and overseen by elected officials or the president. Agencies are created by an enabling statute, which is a state or federal law that gives birth to the agency and outlines the procedures for the agency's rule making. Furthermore, agencies include the public in their rule-making processes. Thus, by proxy, agencies are the will of the electorate. Supporters of administrative agencies note also that agencies are able to adjudicate relatively minor or exceedingly complex disputes more quickly or more flexibly than can state and federal courts, which helps preserve judicial resources and promotes swift resolutions. Opponents argue that swiftness and ease at the expense of fairness are no virtues, but while the debate continues, administrative agencies thrive. Governmental representation in an administrative capacity of any kind can be considered administrative agency. The president is an administrative agent whose enabling statute is the federal Constitution. The thirteen executive departments reporting to the president are administrative agencies. For example, the DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE is a cabinet-level executive department, but it functions as the administrative agency that addresses the legal concerns of the U.S. government and its people."", ""Congressional authority to delegate power\nLocal\nCongressional authority to delegate power\nBrendan Bukalski , Attorney at Law/Ask the Lawyer\nSep. 22, 2013 Updated: Nov. 1, 2016 2:35 p.m.\nQuestion: I know that Congress has created a lot of administrative agencies in order to make their own work load easier. But aren't we awash with them by now? Each year, these administrative agencies pass more and more rules and regulations that make it harder and harder to do anything. Personally, I think that they are one of the reasons why it is harder to do business in this country, and that that is one reason why so many businesses and corporations transfer jobs overseas, where there are fewer regulations. I was debating it with a friend of mine the other day, who feels similarly, and we both got to wondering why is it that we have administrative agencies at all. After all, wasn't Congress created for the purpose of passing laws? And if Congress wanted to pass all these laws, they could. So, how is it that administrative agencies can pass laws without being elected to office?""]";The increase in administrative agencies can be largely attributed to the growing complexity of modern governance and the specialized knowledge required to oversee various facets of public and economic life. As highlighted in the passage, the creation of agencies like the Federal Trade Commission, Food and Drug Administration, and others during significant periods such as the Progressive Era and the New Deal was driven by the need to manage highly technical areas of regulation that required expertise beyond the scope of legislators. Moreover, as regulatory and enforcement needs expanded over time, so did the number and scope of administrative agencies, allowing them to address specific issues more efficiently than Congress could through general legislation.;['Increased government responsibilities', 'Congress delegates authority', 'Addressing complex societal problems', 'Agencies handle complex regulations', 'Growth of administrative state', 'Efficient regulation of modern complexities', 'Agencies enforce laws and regulations', 'Need for specialized expertise', 'Agencies address issues beyond legislature', 'Expansion of federal bureaucracy', 'Managing large-scale projects', 'Evolving societal needs', 'Response to societal crises', 'Demand for data and statistics', 'Specialized agency expertise', 'Growth of government services', 'Overlapping agency functions', 'Concerns about accountability and power', 'Executive and independent agencies differ', 'Congress maintains agency oversight', 'Independent agencies’ insulation', 'Enabling acts define agency authority', 'President’s appointment power', 'Political influence on agency policy', 'Agency autonomy and resource control', 'Regulated industries influence agencies', 'Concentrated benefits, dispersed costs'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.9

Increased availability of  smaller-fruited and seedless types, as well as the development of techniques for selling  watermelon as a precut packaged product, has improved the convenience of serving watermelon. To show a profit, a grower must produce good yields of high-quality melons. High yields  of quality melons can be obtained only with careful management. A good watermelon  yield with irrigation is eight tons per acre in Oklahoma; however, the average yield  is about five tons. With ideal conditions and certain varieties, more than 15 tons  per acre have been achieved. Sites and Soils\nWatermelons grow best on sandy loam soils, with good drainage and a slightly acid  pH.

Tony Anderson, from the Texas Melon Exchange, noted that there was a turnaround in the situation after Memorial Day, leading to an oversupply. Factors contributing to this shift included a bumper crop from the Rio Grande Valley, which resulted in a 25% decrease in watermelon prices compared to the previous year, as described by Ron Catlett of the La Fiesta grocery stores.

In other words, the platform has proven more effective for advertisers — with users much more likely to look at an ad, and the cost for each of those views dropping. This trend is likely related to Twitter’s ongoing efforts to weed out fake accounts, and it bodes well for future growth in advertising revenue and Twitter stock.

But in recent weeks new shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher has gone further.

He ruled out a return to British Rail but said a Labour government would put ""the whole franchising system as it stands today in the bin"". image copyright\nGetty Images\nThe Conservatives are against nationalising the network. A spokesman says that franchising has led to the most improved railways in the EU with record levels of investment, passenger numbers doubling and punctuality rates at record levels. The state ownership of East Coast main line shows that, he argues. ""While most operators spend more per journey than they get from passengers, East Coast hasn\'t. East Coast charged passengers on average more per journey, while running older, cheaper trains than on the privately run West Coast line. The new East Coast franchise will turn that round, bringing new services, new investment, more seats, state-of-the-art new trains and faster journeys - and it will return more to the taxpayer too.""', 'We know there is overwhelming support from the British people for a people’s railway, better and more efficient services, proper integration and fairer fares. On this issue, it won’t work to have a nearly-but-not-quite position. Labour will commit to a clear plan for a fully integrated railway in public ownership.” Corbyn is not likely to have any difficulty getting the proposal through party conference, which has voted for rail renationalisation many times. Nor is it likely to prove particularly problematic with his shadow cabinet, which has made it clear to him that it will not stomach Labour campaigning to leave the EU, withdrawing from Nato or scrapping Trident. However, he is facing the possibility of his first rebellion over the issue of whether the UK joins airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria. The Sunday Times reported (paywall) that up to half of the shadow cabinet were likely to be in favour of action when the prime minister puts his proposal to a Commons vote. This is not likely to happen until after party conferences and only then if the prime minister thinks he can win the vote. Modern capitalism needs an opponent.

The cost rises stem from wastage as shareholder dividend pay-outs, other inefficient private sector financing and inefficiencies created by fragmentation of the railway. The wastage amounts to over £1bn per year, enough to cut fares by 20% if the railway were reunified as a public company. Instead, fare increases on the privatised railway threaten to turn it into a ""rich-man\'s toy"", as this government\'s first Secretary of State for Transport put it. Unbeknown to most passengers, one portion of our railway, the East Coast mainline, is still run by a publicly-owned company, Directly Operated Railways, which picked up the pieces after its two private sector predecessors walked off the job. Recent calculations by the Office of Rail Regulation revealed how the public money that helps maintain the rail tracks or directly supports rail services splits between the train companies and showed that DOR receives less subsidy than any other rail franchise operator. DOR\'s success is a glaring embarrassment for the Government, who now intend to privatise it post-haste, even though that will increase costs to the taxpayer. Most other rail franchises in the UK are, ironically, also run by companies that are wholly or partly publicly owned, but by other countries. Deutsche Bahn is foremost - they even run the Royal Train - and the German Government have said ""We\'re skimming profit from the entire Deutsche Bahn...it is invested in the rail network here in Germany"". So, if you are reading this on an overcrowded train with a ticket that made a painful hole in your wallet, take heart from your generous contribution to improvement of Germany\'s fine publicly-owned railway.', 'He initially made the proposal in a policy document over the summer, suggesting that franchises could be brought back into public hands as they expire.

In a sign he wants clearer policy than his predecessor, Corbyn told the Independent on Sunday: “ We know there is overwhelming support from the British people for a people’s railway, better and more efficient services, proper integration and fairer fares. On this issue, it won’t work to have a nearly-but-not-quite position. Labour will commit to a clear plan for a fully integrated railway in public ownership.” Corbyn is not likely to have any difficulty getting the proposal through party conference, which has voted for rail renationalisation many times. Nor is it likely to prove particularly problematic with his shadow cabinet, which has made it clear to him that it will not stomach Labour campaigning to leave the EU, withdrawing from Nato or scrapping Trident.', ""Labour has suggested that it will review the franchising system and allow the public sector to bid to operate rail lines.

Since then the number of passengers travelling on the railways has doubled. But the public subsidy has risen.

Not difficult at all, says James Abbott, editor of Modern Railways. Network Rail, which manages the track, is already in public hands. The train companies have time-limited franchises.""]";Labour's plan to revive British Rail by transitioning rail franchises into public ownership might face challenges in reducing ticket prices due to several factors highlighted in the passage. Firstly, existing inefficiencies and financial wastage in the management of railways contribute significantly to high operating costs. According to the passage, the transition to public ownership could imply a continuation of these inefficiencies, particularly if the change does not address the root causes such as shareholder dividends and fragmentation. Secondly, public sector operators, like DOR running the East Coast mainline, required continual financial support and still charged high fares, suggesting that public ownership alone may not lead to lower ticket prices. Lastly, the broader financial context involves increased costs to the taxpayer for railway operations and pressures to return profits from UK rail operations to foreign state-owned entities, which further complicates the objective of reducing fares for passengers. Therefore, merely switching to public ownership might not inherently resolve the underlying cost issues needed to lower ticket prices effectively.;['Existing fare structure complexities.', 'Private operators profit from fares.', 'Public ownership doesn’t automatically lower fares.', 'High fixed costs in rail network.', 'Labour’s plan may not fully nationalize.', 'Franchising system complexities.', 'Complex funding mechanisms.', 'Profit going to government, not fares.', 'Public ownership may not eliminate waste.', 'Government interference hinders efficiency.', 'Messy privatization legacy.', 'Political opposition to nationalization.', 'Network Rail ownership unclear.', 'Subsidies may not decrease.', 'Increased competition not guaranteed.'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay'];['partial_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support'];0.2857142857142857

Women made many advances during the century's first decade, as they built upon the accomplishments of those who had demanded more equal treatment during the 1800s. In the 1900s, women were increasingly joining the workforce at all levels. Immigrant and working-class females began to be employed outside the home as opportunities in manufacturing and retailing expanded. Educated women made greater advances in both the academic and professional spheres as they joined the ranks of doctors, lawyers, and professors who had previously been all male. By 1910, nearly 40 percent of America's undergraduates were female. Women were also greatly involved in social work and religious causes. Jane Addams inspired generations of women into action through her efforts at Hull House, a settlement house in Chicago that educated and helped immigrants. Many women, such as Carry Nation, joined the Temperance Movement (a movement to limit alcohol consumption) and rallied for the prohibition of alcohol. Another social concern that drew the attention of many women was suffrage, or the right to vote."", 'The atmosphere of reform, combined with a broader job market and already changing lifestyles, gave rise to a new women’s movement. The growth of big business opened new fields for women, such as saleswoman and clerk, as well as bringing more women into the factory system. Mass production introduced household conveniences, which allowed more leisure time for middle class women. Educational opportunities expanded and a new generation of college graduates sought fulfillment in the world outside the home. However, women often found their efforts thwarted by a male-dominated society and a Victorian view of the female role. In most states, women could not vote, and in some states married women could not sign contracts without the consent of their husbands. As women tried to address the social problems of the day, they had to contend with the rather entrenched view that women were intellectually and emotionally inferior to men. The following sections depict how women organized to support social reform and to redefine the role of women at the last turn of the century. Settlement House Workers\nMany women resented the restraints society placed on them. Jane Addams, founder of Hull House in Chicago, typified the attitudes of the first group of college-educated women.', ""The Lives of Women in the Early 1900s | Synonym\nThe Lives of Women in the Early 1900s\nThe early 1900s in the United States was a time of change in many ways, and women, in particular, would soon undergo challenges that would lead to big societal benefits. Until that time, women had been confined to the home in the traditional roles of wife and mother, but their lives began to reflect the growing trend of industrialization and technological developments. As a result of these advancements, women started entering the workforce in larger numbers, expecting better working conditions and wages, seeking higher education and demanding the right to vote. Explore this article\nWomen in the Workforce\nWomen's Suffrage\nWorld War I\nResistance to Reform\n1 Women in the Workforce\nAt the start of the 20th century, 18.8 percent of women were employed outside the home, with many working in factories, as retail sales clerks, typists, nurses and schoolteachers. They often worked very long hours, were poorly paid and their daily working environment could be difficult and even unsafe. This led to the establishment of the Women's Trade Union League in 1903, which worked to develop better working conditions for women, and also encouraged women to join the labor movement. 2 Women's Suffrage\nThe women's suffrage movement was making more inroads in the early 20th century. More than 20 states had already granted partial suffrage to women. This typically meant that voting rights were only granted to certain classes of women, who could only vote on certain matters, such as local issues concerning schools and bonds. They were barred from voting in congressional and presidential campaigns."", 'Men and women rarely competed for jobs, primarily because of division of labor according to gender. In the industrial sector, men had opportunities and could claim jobs that required physical strength, while women were confined to lowpaying jobs using light machinery. Although by 1910 one-third of the workforce was female, half of these women workers were involved in agriculture or domestic service, leaving little female representation in industry. Children were often exploited as workers. Until regulation ended the practice, child labor was common. In 1900 more than 250,000 children under the age of fifteen worked in factories for minimal pay. Average union wages in 1900 were thirty-four cents per hour, compared to non-union, unskilled pay of fifteen cents per hour. The average workweek in the decade was fifty-three hours. Unskilled laborers especially faced many difficulties, since their income would not support a family of five even if they worked twelve hours a day every day of the year. The century began with businesses expanding by merging with similar companies (horizontal integration) and taking on additional functions in the production and sale of their products (vertical integration).', ""The result was the elimination of competition. Many Americans became concerned about the continued rise of big business through trusts, trade associations, cartels, or pools. They feared that these business groups would destroy America's image as the land of opportunity where it was possible for an individual to succeed through his or her own business efforts. The 1900s witnessed the founding of numerous corporations that have since become fixtures in American life: Firestone Tire and Rubber Company (1900), United States Steel Company (1901), Quaker Oats Company (1901), J.C. Penney Company (1902), Pepsi-Cola Company (1902), Texaco (1903), Harley-Davidson (1907), Hershey (1908), and General Motors Corporation (1908). The general prosperity of the decade made many Americans eager consumers, especially as companies began to spend more time and money on product advertising. The rise of big business and poor working conditions for common laborers led to increased tensions between employers and employees. Throughout the decade many workers joined organized labor unions, but their efforts to improve pay and workplace conditions were often unsuccessful. Several long and violent strikes occurred during the 1900s, and some of these work stoppages required government intervention to resolve the disputes. The great differences in the lifestyles of owners and workers was highly publicized, notably through the Anthracite Coal Strike.""]";In the 1900s, many women flocked to big corporations and the broader workforce for several compelling reasons. Firstly, the growth of big businesses created new job opportunities in fields like sales, clerical work, and the factory system, which were more accessible to women. Secondly, the era was marked by significant social reform and an expanding educational landscape, allowing more women to pursue higher education and then seek professional roles outside of traditional domestic duties. Lastly, the rise of mass production and household conveniences granted middle-class women more leisure time, which they could invest in both work and social reform efforts, contributing to their increased presence in the corporate workforce.;['World War I labor shortages', 'World War II labor shortages', 'Higher wages than domestic work', 'Expanding factory system offered jobs', 'Escape poverty and farm/mill work', 'Urbanization and new job markets', 'New clerical and office jobs', 'Rise of department stores and retail', 'Increased demand for factory workers', 'New job opportunities in sales', 'Mass production created new roles', 'Women sought financial independence', 'Desire for personal freedom', 'Challenging societal gender roles', 'Improved wages and benefits (eventually)', 'Consumerism fueled job growth', 'Increased opportunities in wartime industries', 'More job options than traditional roles', 'Progressive Era social changes', 'Growth of new industries'];['vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'support'];0.5

There are many factors making land optimum for the purpose of growing plants, including soil quality, climate and location. Even those who are raising only animals need farmland that is able to grow quality pasture for the animals to eat. Soil\nOne of the most important aspects of a successful farm is the quality of the soil. Good soil is full of organic material and has the ability to effectively transport water and nutrients to plants. It does this by having a high quantity of rich biological components, and by having a balance of sand, clay, dirt and rock that provides a stable, well-drained environment for plants. Drainage\nA very swampy property is unusable for almost anything. Plants need to have well-drained soil that will maintain some moisture, but will also allow water to drain away."", 'Even non-organic farms would not want to be downstream from a factory, which could potentially poison the groundwater and ultimately anything growing there.

General systems theory, social cognitive theory, stress and coping theory, general adaptation theories, and developmental theories are just some of the commonly “borrowed” theories and frameworks that have influenced the development of nursing theory (Masters, 2015). How to Decide if a Borrowed Theory “Fits” the Nursing Profession\nRemember that nursing theories describe, explain, or predict nursing phenomena.', 'According to Johnson and Webber (2015), the point of a discipline-specific theory is to identify the knowledge that is exclusive (to a point) to a particular specialty or branch of learning. Its purpose is also to provide a database that can be used to “answer questions, solve problems, and describe and explain discipline-specific phenomena” (p. 78). In the case of nursing theory, the questions, problems, and discipline-specific phenomena are related to nursing care designed to improve and promote the health and well-being of persons under their care. Borrowed Theory in Nursing\nBorrowed theory is simply theoretical or conceptual models/frameworks from disciplines other than nursing that are used in the nursing domain (Villaruel et al., 2001). Nurses may use borrowed theories in conjunction with nursing theories to inform and guide practice (though theories should be examined for congruence with nursing ideals and situations) (Thompson, 2016). Borrowed theories have formed the basis of much nursing theory development. Johnson and Webber (2015) call this supporting theory instead of borrowed theory and explain that nurses don’t “give back” the borrowed concepts, as they are part of a “theoretical DNA” of many nursing theories (p. 79). I like this explanation because it supposes that there are no pure theories, but all have seeds of thoughts that have come before. But you have to start somewhere when developing a unique body of knowledge.', 'Nurses may use borrowed theories in conjunction with nursing theories to inform and guide practice (though theories should be examined for congruence with nursing ideals and situations) (Thompson, 2016).

Even though there are many nursing theories that could be used to guide research studies, many nursing studies use non-nursing theories.', 'For a theory to be useful to nursing practice — it has to fit. Nurses shouldn’t assume that theory from non-nursing disciplines, even if related to healthcare, will work in a shared capacity as a theory for nursing care (Villaruel et al., 2001). For example, in a discussion about the concept of empathy, borrowed from the discipline of psychology, Walker and Alligood (2001) pointed out that fit is often assumed because concepts in healthcare seem to transcend discipline. But if this premise is critically examined, one could find contradictions or challenges to those assumptions. “ The direct application of borrowed theories of empathy assumed that context and content applicable to the psychotherapist-patient relationship were directly transferable to the nurse-patient relationship” (p. 141). I think you can see that it makes sense that there might be differences between the psychotherapist-patient relationship and the nurse-patient relationship? Many papers have been written on how to evaluate borrowed theories for fit in nursing (Villaruel et al., 2001). “ The linkage of a nursing conceptual model and a borrowed theory must first take into consideration the logical congruence of worldviews that undergird the conceptual model and the theory” (p. 160).']";Nursing should borrow theories from other disciplines because no single nursing model, such as Nightingale’s Notes, comprehensively covers all phenomena that nurses encounter in practice. Borrowing theories can fill these gaps, providing diverse perspectives and frameworks that help elucidate and manage the complex issues in healthcare that nurses face.

They’re learning from actual readers which parts aren’t as strong as they think. All first drafts are bad. Many second drafts are too. The process of writing is rewriting and shaping material over many drafts into something good. A good read is usually the result of many revisions of a bad one. Most serious writers also work with editors, particularly developmental editors who can guide and give advice broadly about what is working, or not, about each draft. The challenge is it’s hard to find people who give thorough and useful feedback beyond “I like it” or “I hate it”.'];People often read poorly written books for several reasons. Initially, some readers may not initially realize that a book is poorly written until they are already committed to finishing it. Additionally, there could be elements within these books, such as occasional brilliant sentences or unique images, that hold a reader's attention despite overall poor quality. Furthermore, reading poorly written books can serve as a learning tool, offering readers insight into what not to do in their writing, helping them recognize flaws in writing style, vocabulary, plot, or organization.;['Escapism', 'Easy to read', 'Engaging despite flaws', 'Compelling story despite flaws', 'Emotional needs', 'Satisfies dissatisfaction with reality', 'Habit', 'Convenience', 'Time filler', 'Part of a series', 'Recommended', 'Social pressure', 'Accessibility', 'Relatability', 'Lack of alternatives', 'Curiosity', 'Poorly written but enjoyable', 'Hate-reading', 'Unintentional selection'];['Vital', 'Okay', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Vital', 'Okay', 'Okay', 'Vital', 'Vital', 'Okay'];['not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support'];0.0

Although the idea of any political consciousness on the part of the dēmos in the 7th century is optimistic, it is true that early tyrants tended to have popular support. Figures such as Cypselus at Corinth and Cleisthenes at Sicyon offered an alternative to exploitation by the aristocrats, and certainly tyrants introduced reforms intended to please the dēmos, codifying the laws and establishing justice—Peisistratus in Athens set up traveling courts—and gathering resources for public projects, such as fountains to supply water and grand temples. Thus, the tyrants of the Archaic age of ancient Greece ( c. 900–500 bce )—Cypselus, Cleisthenes, Peisistratus, and Polycrates —were popular, presiding as they did over an era of prosperity and expansion. But those attitudes shifted in the course of the 5th century under the influence of the Persian invasions of Greece in 480–479 bce. Most sources for Greek history are Athenian, and for them the defining moments of the Athenian state were the establishment of the democracy in 510 bce and the Greeks’ astonishing defeat of Persia in the next generation. The outcome of the Greco-Persian Wars was interpreted as the success of the free and democratic Greeks against the autocratic and tyrannical Persian king; consequently, in Athenian writing after 480 bce tyranny became the hated opposite of democracy. That coloured attitudes toward tyranny in the past as well; rulership that had previously seemed positive and acceptable was condemned as oppressive and self-serving.', 'A\n \nnew\n \ngroup\n \nof\n \nrulers\n \nemerged,\n \nthe\n \n“tyrants.” Greek\n \ntyrants\n \nseized\n \npower\n \nfrom\n \nthe\n \naristocrats\n \nby\n \nforce,\n \nor\n \nmilitary\n \nstrength.

Once in power, they would provide public works projects, pay off unpaid debt, and build infrastructure. At times, they would even establish trade or alliances to further improve stability and prosperity throughout Ancient Greece.

Tyrants often introduced measures to improve the economic and social status of the poor; it was the aristocracy (who wrote the histories) who tended to oppose tyranny, because, in bypassing the constitution, tyranny threatened their traditional privileges. But as absolute rule became established in the Roman Empire, the terms of debate shifted, focusing on the question of when monarchic power became tyrannical in nature. From that springs the idea of tyranny in its modern sense: a situation in which the power of the ruler outweighs that of the ruled. That definition allows even a representative government to be labeled a tyranny. Sian Lewis\nLearn More in these related Britannica articles: United Kingdom: The decline of Roman rule\n…gradually into the hands of tyrants.', 'Those rulers had certain fundamental features in common. They were sole rulers with direct and personal power over the state, unconstrained by political institutions. Their power was dependent not on a right to rule but on their own ability to command and retain control. All tyrants aimed to hand power on within their family, and some succeeded in establishing a rule lasting many generations. Although few surviving classical authors have anything good to say of tyrants, they were generally successful in government, bringing economic prosperity and expansion to their cities. The Aristotelian view suggests that tyrants were inevitably unpopular, ruling a cowed citizenry who feared and hated them and wished only to be free. But some tyrants were chosen by the state to rule with a specific purpose: to put an end to civil war, to impose a new code of law, or to offer leadership in a time of danger. Indeed, it was often proposed that a sole ruler with overall control of military and political affairs was the best option in wartime. Though opposed to monarchy on principle, the Romans during the republic (509–27 bce) would in times of threat appoint a dictator, one individual who was granted complete control over the army and state for a period of six months, a position described by the historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus as an “elective tyranny.”']";Some tyrants were well-liked because they were seen as champions of the common people, often rising to power with their support and implementing reforms to improve their socioeconomic status. Tyrants like Cypselus, Cleisthenes, and Peisistratus were popular for their public works projects, codification of laws, and efforts to diminish the power of oppressive aristocracies which directly benefited the everyday lives of the citizens. Additionally, by providing services such as food and debt forgiveness, they secured the loyalty and favor of the populace, at least initially, until the perception and reality of their rule began to change over time.;['Effective governance, decisive leadership', 'Ending civil strife, offering stability', 'Economic prosperity and expansion', 'Protection from external threats', 'Public works, infrastructure improvements', 'Charismatic leadership, popular image', 'National unity, identity building', 'Cult of personality, propaganda', 'Initially benevolent rule', 'Addressing aristocratic exploitation', 'Strong military, popular support', 'Religious/ideological appeal', 'Debt relief, aid to the poor', 'Seizing power during crises'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support'];0.0

The attempts to resolve the dilemma of alienation, understandable as they are, would find concrete and political expression in fascism. [ 7]\nRomanticism\nRomanticism became the antidote to alienation. It asserted the value of the natural world in that it was seen not as a machine, but as a living organism. Nature must not be approached with reason and intellect, but by experience, emotions, and irrationalism, as opposed to rationalism. The immanence of God (or gods) was emphasized while transcendence was denied. Romanticism was also characterized by nostalgia for the past and an admiration for the primitive. It was believed that primitive cultures were morally superior because they were more in tune with the natural world. Isaiah Berlin in his book: The Roots of Romanticism, says:', 'These processes, combined with the profit motive, “degraded and despoiled”, as some romantics saw it, the environment (although they would not have used the term). Cities expanded to unprecedented sizes, and grew into into centres of pollution, poverty and deprivation. They began to symbolise the failure of laissez faire liberalism’s philosophy that permitting people to follow their self-interest would lead to a perfect society. Population movement from the land, and rational search for economically efficient production methods (involving division of labour, timekeeping and mechanisation) led, according to the Romantic Movement, to spiritual alienation of the masses from the land and nature. As Marx and Engels perceived it, they became units of production: cogs in an impersonal productive machine. People and nature were objectified, and reduced to commodity status. This was regarded as undesirable and leading to the degradation of the humans. According to the romantics, the solution was “back to nature” because nature was seen as pure and a spiritual source of renewal. It was also a way out of the fumes of the growing industrial centres for the new industrial rich.', 'For the Romantics, nature was innocent, something to protect against industrial development and urban expansion. This view placed children in a new perspective. The notion of children\'s proximity to nature remained the same, but its significance changed. The Romantics mourned maturing children\'s progressive acculturation and alienation from nature. They wished to mitigate the process that predecessors had striven to accelerate. The impulse to protect children\'s innocence -- the very notion of children\'s innocence -- is a Romantic legacy. 3 Individualism\nAttempts to recover the lost wisdom of childhood led Romantics to reflection and introspection. This fascination with subjectivity contributed to the Romantic Movement\'s veneration of individualism. Romantic individualism, however, is hardly confined to the period from 1770 to 1840. Writing in 1830, Victor Hugo called Romanticism ""liberalism in literature,"" and despite 21st-century politics\' specialized use of ""liberalism,"" the term chiefly denotes an assumption of inborn autonomy, free will and personal liberty.', 'In the 18th century, Hutcheson introduced a distinction between alienable and unalienable rights in the legal sense of the term. Rousseau published influential works on the same theme, and is also seen as having popularized a more psychological-social concept relating to alienation from a state of nature due to the expansion of civil society or the nation state . In the same century a law of alienation of affection was introduced for men to seek compensation from other men accused of taking away \'their\' woman. In the history of literature, the German Romantics appear to be the first group of writers and poets in whose work the concept of alienation is regularly found. Around the start of the 19th century, Hegel popularized a Christian ( Lutheran) and Idealist philosophy of alienation. He used German terms in partially different senses, referring to a psychological state and an objective process, and in general posited that the self was an historical and social creation, which becomes alienated from itself via a perceived objective world, but can become de-alienated again when that world is seen as just another aspect of the self-consciousness, which may be achieved by self-sacrifice to the common good. Around the same time, Pinel was popularizing a new understanding of mental alienation, particularly through his \'medical-philosophical treatise\'. He argued that people could be disturbed (alienated) by emotional states and social conditions, without necessarily having lost (become alienated from) their reason, as had generally been assumed. Hegel praised Pinel for his \' moral treatment \' approach, and developed related theories. Nevertheless, as Foucault would later write, ""... in an obscure, shared origin, the \'alienation\' of physicians and the \'alienation\' of philosophers started to take shape—two configurations in which man in any case corrupts his truth, but between which, after Hegel, the nineteenth century stopped seeing any trace of resemblance.""', 'that is, a search for holistic or integrated perception, an emphasis on interdependence and relatedness in nature, and an intense desire to restore man to a place of intimate intercourse with the vast organism that constitutes the earth"" (82). More recently, in his introduction to ""Romanticism and Ecology,"" a special issue of The Wordsworth Circle, Jim McKusick pointedly and rightly, I think, claims that ""much Romantic writing emerges from a desperate sense of alienation from the natural world and expresses an anxious endeavor to re-establish a vital, sustainable relationship between mankind and the fragile planet on which [we] dwell"" (123). These statements point to a position that many recent writers have defended, albeit from divergent and importantly nuanced perspectives: Romantic literature is a germinal site for the rise of ecological consciousness and practices. The affiliation between Romanticism and ecology nonetheless remains problematic. On the one hand, Romantic nature philosophy has been linked, as in Luc Ferry\'s The New Ecological Order, with oppressive and totalitarian political dispositions. On the other hand, Romanticism has been reduced to a simplistic nostalgia for a lost unity with nature, or worse, as a rhapsodic celebration of beautiful scenery. In reply to such critics as Ferry, Val Plumwood in Environmental Culture reminds us that ""While it is important to note the role of those forms of Romanticism corrupted by the desire for unity and other oppressive forces, any analysis which puts all its stress on this factor ignores the diversity and liberatory aspects of some forms of Romanticism. . . . "" ( 208). In response to the reductive view of Romanticism as nature worship, William Cronon and Paul Fry, among others, remind us that Romantic representations of nature reflect not so much actual places and encounters as virtual landscapes and experiences that mirror their writers\' projected desires and culturally mediated values.']";Alienation was a central theme in Romanticism because it reflected a deep sense of detachment and disillusionment with the industrialization and urbanization occurring at the time. Romantic thinkers and artists saw the rapid industrial growth and the mechanization of society as dehumanizing, leading to a spiritual and emotional disconnection from nature and from each other. In response, Romanticism emphasized returning to nature, valuing the subjective, and celebrating individualism as ways to combat this alienation and restore a sense of personal and communal integrity.;['Alienation contrasted societal conformity', 'Alienation from bourgeois society and morality', 'Alienation symbolized search for authentic existence', 'Romantic heroes embodied alienation and rebellion', 'Alienation reflected emotional depth and individualism', 'Alienation highlighted emotional intensity', 'Alienation a critique of Industrial Revolution', 'Alienation a catalyst for creativity', 'Alienation fueled Romantic artistic expression', 'Nature offered solace from societal alienation', 'Individualism arose as response to alienation', 'Alienation expressed pain of societal disconnect', 'Rejection of Enlightenment rationality'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital'];['partial_support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support'];0.3333333333333333

The Medellin cartel had other plans. According to Boston George, the Medellin cartel began to see cocaine as a weapon that could be used to undermine American society. “Carlos [Lehder] had the concept where he wanted to flood the country with cocaine and destroy the political and moral structure of the United States. As he stated, cocaine was the atomic bomb and he was going to drop it on America,” said Boston George in a Frontline interview in 2000. Crack had a devastating effect on American cities. Crime rates soared as people scrambled to feed cocaine addictions. The huge sums of cash involved in cocaine trafficking made drug deals violent. Drug traffickers understood that marijuana deals were conducted with a handshake, cocaine deals with a gun. Flooding the U.S. with cocaine proved to be an unwise business decision.', 'Also killed in 1989 were the Unión Patriótica presidential candidate José Antequera, El Espectador lawyer Hector Giraldo, Bucaramanga radio newsman Luis Vera, judge Martha Gonzales’s father, Medellin reporter Jorge Vallejo, Antioquia governor Antonio Roldan, superior tribunal magistrate Carlos Valencia, and more. That same year, Forbes listed Escobar as the seventh-richest man in the world with $3 billion. Changing Attitudes in Washington\nAround the same time, American public opinion turned strongly against cocaine with the crack epidemic and Reagan’s “Say NO to Drugs.” Plus, the power the traffickers wielded was destabilizing the region. The Cold War was still on, and US officials worried socialist regimes would get in bed with the cartels. A photo of Escobar’s cocaine being shipped from Nicaragua emerged (1980s Sandinistas ‘ Nicaragua). After ten years of Plan Colombia, using US military to combat drugs doesn’t seem outside the box. But in the 1980s it was unprecedented. The new political implications led the US government to consider Escobar a “clear and present danger.” The potential for teaming with socialists set the stage.', 'He also declared that Communists were behind the distribution of marijuana in the U.S. in order to make Americans “weak” and easy to conquer. In the Cold War hysteria of the 50s, this campaign was his most successful yet. He convinced President Truman to sign the Briggs Act which substantially increased penalties for marijuana possession. In 1958, following the lead of other states, Virginia passed one of the harshest new laws for marijuana which required a minimum twenty years in jail for marijuana possession, with no parole. At that same time, Virginia law provided for a minimum fifteen years for murder and ten years for rape. Medicine drug abuse in the 50s: The development of prescription and non-prescription medication\nAfter WWII there was an amazing development of new medicines: tranquilizers, new amphetamines and barbiturates, new opioids (synthesized opium products). Weight loss products were sold containing amphetamines and ephedrine. National marketing of these medicines increased their use.', 'In the 1950s, the U.S. preoccupation with stopping the spread of Communism led to alliances with drug warlords in the Golden Triangle. The U.S. and France supplied the drug warlords and their armies with ammunition, arms, and air transport for the production and sale of opium. The result was an explosion in the availability and illegal flow of heroin into the United States and into the hands of drug dealers and addicts. During the U.S. war in Vietnam, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) set up a charter airline, Air America, to transport raw opium from Burma and Laos.

The unprecedented appeal of New York salsa, particularly the ""Fania sound"", led to its adoption across Latin America and elsewhere. Globally, the term salsa has eclipsed the original names of the various Cuban musical genres it encompasses. Ironically, Cuban-based music was promoted more effectively worldwide in the 1970s and 1980s by the salsa industry, than by Cuba.

After achieving popularity in Cuba, visiting musicians from United States soon became intoxicated  with this awesome music and dance style, carrying it back to the states where they kick-started popular age of Latin music domination that never stopped. Even though modern salsa was born in Cuba, its origins can be traced back to other lands and earlier parts of our history. Basic components of Salsa have  been brought together by countless immigrants who came into Latin America searching better life or being brought there against their will (African slaves). By combining Danzón dance of French and Haiti immigrants, Rumbas of African slaves, Són of the Cuban people, troubadour music of Spanish people (mostly  Flamenco) and various musical instruments of Africa, Salsa became first performed for the first time during final years of 19th century.

In the 1970s, adoption of the term “Salsa” reduced the linguistic and cultural barriers to mainstream adoption of Latin music and dance. The modernization of the Mambo in the 1950s was influential in shaping what would become salsa. There is debate as to whether the dance we call Salsa today originated in Cuba or Puerto Rico. Cuba’s influence in North America was diminished after Castro’s revolution and the ensuing trade embargo. New York’s Latino community was largely Puerto-Rican. Salsa is one of the main dances in both Cuba and Puerto Rico and is known world-wide. Interpretations of what the salsa dance is\nThe late Celia Cruz, hailed by many as the queen of salsa, said that salsa does not exist as a rhythm, but that it is rather an exclamation for music such as guaracha, bolero, cha cha cha, danzon, son, rumba, etc. The famous Latin composer and band leader Tito Puente also argued that there is no such thing as salsa but only mambo, rumba, danzon and cha cha cha, etc. According to the late David Melendez, one of the first organizers of the East Coast Salsa Congress and a salsa dancer in New York since the 1970s, the word ‘Salsa’ first referred to the music.']";"Salsa was initially unnoticed in America due to a combination of factors, including cultural and linguistic barriers.

Finland has vastly improved in reading, math and science literacy over the past decade in large part because its teachers are trusted to do whatever it takes to turn young lives around. This 13-year-old, Besart Kabashi, received something akin to royal tutoring. “I took Besart on that year as my private student,” Louhivuori told me in his office, which boasted a Beatles “Yellow Submarine” poster on the wall and an electric guitar in the closet. When Besart was not studying science, geography and math, he was parked next to Louhivuori’s desk at the front of his class of 9- and 10-year- olds, cracking open books from a tall stack, slowly reading one, then another, then devouring them by the dozens. By the end of the year, the son of Kosovo war refugees had conquered his adopted country’s vowel-rich language and arrived at the realization that he could, in fact, learn.

In the next section, we’ll look at Europe’s discovery of a route to the “New World” in the Americas and explore why it is so important in understanding modern imperialism. The most important motive for early European exploration across the Atlantic was the dream of enormous riches. Initially, explorers and merchants hoped to find a sea route across the Atlantic to the thriving markets of Asia. But Columbus and his fellow Europeans greatly miscalculated the circumference of the earth. Instead, they found a whole new world to explore and exploit: North and South America. The risks were high when Spaniards and Portuguese first sailed across uncharted oceans.', '‹ ›\nThere were many long-term consequences of the European conquest of the Americas and the global exchange that ensued. It took the Spanish only a few years to find and plunder the two wealthiest empires in the Americas. Huge silver mines found in Mexico and Peru in the mid-16th century meant that Spain instantly became the largest supplier of silver in the world. In the first 150 years following conquest, the Spanish exported 32 million pounds of silver and 360,000 pounds of gold (Marks 78). Spain spent much of this wealth in costly wars in a failed attempt to rule Europe. Much of this silver eventually ended up in China, but we’ll learn more about that later. The depopulation of large regions of the Americas also led Europeans to search for cheap labor. Perhaps the most important consequence of the Colombian Exchange was the forced migration and enslavement of millions of people. While the Spanish conquered Mexico and Peru, the Portuguese subjugated Brazil and, as a result, led the way in trafficking enslaved people to the Americas. They started in 1441 in western Africa (Getz 86).', 'The first truly global trade was also the most nefarious. It set the precedent of using African slaves to create cash crops to be sold abroad in a global market. Eighty percent of the 11 million enslaved Africans who came to the Americas went to sugar plantation regions of Brazil and the Caribbean (90). The slave trade certainly had enormous political, economic, and social implications in western and central Africa. Europeans could not conquer African nations because many were powerful and because various diseases, such as malaria and yellow fever, made it extremely dangerous for Europeans to enter into the interior of the continent. Along the coasts the Portuguese (followed by the Spanish and English) traded firearms, tobacco, cotton, Indian cloth, iron bars, and liquor for enslaved people. It is estimated that central and west Africans acquired over 20 million guns from Europeans during the slave trade, mostly between 1650 and 1850 (Getz 96). This global trade shattered the stability, wealth, and human capital of African nations. On the brutal Middle Passage alone, 1 to 1.5 million Africans died of sickness, abuse, and dehydration (90).

The Fall of Constantinople had a profound impact on two of the most prominent Italian city-states, Venice and Genoa, both of whom were great trading and maritime powers. The Fall of Constantinople led to the collapse of Genoese influence in the Eastern Mediterranean and the loss of the city's key ally. Likewise, why was the conquest a turning point in global history?""]";The conquest of the Americas by European powers was a turning point in global history primarily due to its transformative effects on trade, economics, and geopolitics. First, it led to the establishment of a completely global market, significantly changing the dynamics of international trade and increasing competition among Europe's leading nations.

Arizona\nMilitary service: US Army (1958-59, dishonorably discharged)\nErnesto Miranda was an eighth-grade dropout who was charged in the 1963 kidnapping and rape of a mildly retarded 18-year-old woman. He was found guilty of both crimes, based largely on his confession during police interrogations. The convictions were overturned by the US Supreme Court in 1966, because he had never been told by police that he had the Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination by not answering questions, and the Sixth Amendment right to have an attorney present during interrogation. Since Miranda\'s convictions were overturned, police in America have generally been required to explain these Constitutional rights in cases where a suspect\'s testimony may be used against him/her in court. In common parlance, this is called the Miranda warning, and while the phrasing may vary, it usually sounds something like this: "" You have the right to remain silent; anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.', 'During the case of Miranda v.

That being said, additional evidence that was placed on Ernesto Miranda affirmed his initial rape conviction. Miranda ended up spending 11 years in prison; however, the case of Miranda v. Arizona made history. The Miranda rights are now included in the 5th Amendment, stating that all individuals retain the right to remain silent to avoid getting themselves in trouble at the time of arrest.

There exists a myriad of reasons why parents will not relinquish the education of their children to others. This has spawned the developing movement of homeschooling. Unfortunately, our parents are not generally equipped to teacher their own children basic reasoning and logic. An extreme example is evolution science and creationism in classrooms. Rather than be taught to reason through science, many parents find it more appropriate to pull their children from discussions on evolution if it is not taught alongside creationism or intelligent design. They argue that children should be allowed to evaluate all these theories themselves. Children don’t know how to do that yet. It takes time to understand these theories and beliefs. Most adults can not weigh the argument and evidence from any of these realms appropriately to come up with a reasonable answer.', 'Rather than be taught to reason through science, many parents find it more appropriate to pull their children from discussions on evolution if it is not taught alongside creationism or intelligent design.

Most adults can not weigh the argument and evidence from any of these realms appropriately to come up with a reasonable answer. Because they were taught that belief matters more than knowledge. And here is our problem. We, as a society, have decided that our beliefs have more value, are more reliable, than objective truths. We reinforce this every single day, from school age and onward into adulthood. We bully those who pursue knowledge, we mock them and shame them for their efforts from childhood onward.', 'What is controversial is whether the same mechanism that drives change within a species is capable of changing one species into another (sometimes called “macroevolution”). Ultimately, evolutionists claim that all species on Earth today descend from a single species that lived 3.5 billion years ago. This is the claim most Christians object to. When Christian parents negatively overreact to the mere idea of evolution, they can quickly lose credibility with their kids for not understanding and interacting with the issues more deeply. Our kids need us to understand what they are learning and how to process it scientifically and scripturally. If this is an area you don’t feel confident talking to your kids about, it’s important to get up to speed. 2. There is scientific evidence both consistent and inconsistent with evolutionary theory. I didn’t hear much about evolution growing up, but I do clearly remember my youth group leader laughing it off one day: “ Yeah, right, like we all really came from apes!”', 'Teachers face pressure not only to eliminate or de-emphasize the teaching of evolution, but to introduce scientific misinformation and non-science into science classrooms. This pressure comes from overt advocacy of nonscientific views, such as “creation science,” “intelligent design,” or other forms of creationism, as well as the implicit advancement of those nonscientific views to “teach the controversy” or present “strengths and weaknesses of evolution.” Twisting and abusing core pedagogical principles, such as critical thinking and scientific inquiry is another strategy designed to open science classroom doors to non-science. Declarations\nWithin this context, NSTA recommends that\nScience curricula, state science standards, and teachers should emphasize evolution in a manner commensurate with its importance as a unifying concept in science and its overall explanatory power. Science teachers should not advocate any religious interpretations of the natural world and should be nonjudgmental about the personal beliefs of students. Policy makers and administrators should not mandate policies requiring the teaching of “creation science” or related concepts, such as so-called “intelligent design,” “abrupt appearance,” and “arguments against evolution.” Administrators also should support teachers in resisting pressures to promote nonscientific views, to deemphasize or eliminate the study of evolution, or to misrepresent the nature of science and how questions in science are answered by asking students to consider the validity of evolution through a classroom debate. Administrators and school boards should provide support to teachers as they review, adopt, and implement curricula that emphasize evolution. Professional development designed to assist teachers in teaching evolution in a comprehensive and informed manner is an essential part of this support. Parental and community involvement in establishing and supporting the goals of science education and the curriculum development process should be encouraged and nurtured in our democratic society.', 'Policy makers and administrators should not mandate policies requiring the teaching of “creation science” or related concepts, such as so-called “intelligent design,” “abrupt appearance,” and “arguments against evolution.” Administrators also should support teachers in resisting pressures to promote nonscientific views, to deemphasize or eliminate the study of evolution, or to misrepresent the nature of science and how questions in science are answered by asking students to consider the validity of evolution through a classroom debate.

This leads to a desire for alternative concepts like creationism or intelligent design to be taught alongside evolution, allowing children the opportunity to evaluate all theories themselves. Additionally, the passage indicates a broader societal issue where subjective beliefs are often valued over objective truths, influencing parents to fear that exclusive teaching of evolution could undermine their religious teachings at home.;['Conflict with religious beliefs', 'Evolution contradicts biblical creation', 'Fear of undermining faith', 'Evolution seen as promoting atheism', 'Desire to teach creationism', 'Misunderstanding of scientific theory', 'Perceived threat to moral values', 'Parents want to control education', 'Desire to protect children from controversial ideas', 'Evolution seen as a threat to traditional values', 'Concerns about social Darwinism', 'Evolution seen as incomplete or flawed', 'Marxist origins of some evolutionary thought', 'Atheistic worldview promoted by evolution', 'Humanist Manifesto aligns with evolution'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.75

But a little-known part of the state-federal health insurance program for the poor has long paid about $2 billion a year for emergency treatment for a group of patients who, according to hospitals, mostly comprise this class of immigrants."" A 2007 report by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that in a four-year period, about 99 percent of those who used Emergency Medicaid were determined to be immigrants that entered this country illegally. This only covers emergency room care, but many thousands of patients in the United States who lack health insurance but who need long-term care wind up lingering in hospitals for many weeks, months or even years because the current healthcare system doesn\'t offer workable solutions for them. There is a term for these people: "" permanent patients,"" because they have no relatives, insurance or an established address where they can go once released. Ashish Jha, associate professor of health policy and management at Harvard School of Public Health, told NBC, ""It\'s completely illogical that hospitals have to spend about $2,000 a day on patients who could be cared for much more cheaply in a skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility. But because the law prohibits hospitals from discharging patients without a plan in place for ongoing care — and because nursing homes and rehabs are not required to take patients without insurance — many hospitals wind up keeping these patients for long periods of time.""

Those who are sarcastic are the rulers of the universe, displaying more wit and intelligence than any other personality type (that was sarcasm, obviously). But, in all seriousness, snarky commentary is a quick way to get misunderstood. But sarcasm isn't necessarily a bad trait to possess. Below are just a few things you should know about sarcastic individuals and their shared smart-aleck personality type: NBC via Getty Images\n1. Sarcasm may be a sign of good brain health. Research shows that a little sarcasm can be a good thing when it comes to cognitive function. In fact, an inability to detect sarcasm may even be a sign of brain problems or disease, like dementia. Through a series of MRIs, scientists found that sarcasm lives in the parahippocampal gyrus, the part of the brain associated with memory."", '“It’s practically the primary language” in modern society, says John Haiman, a linguist at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, and the author of Talk is Cheap: Sarcasm, Alienation and the Evolution of Language. Sarcasm seems to exercise the brain more than sincere statements do. Scientists who have monitored the electrical activity of the brains of test subjects exposed to sarcastic statements have found that brains have to work harder to understand sarcasm. That extra work may make our brains sharper, according to another study. College students in Israel listened to complaints to a cellphone company’s customer service line. The students were better able to solve problems creatively when the complaints were sarcastic as opposed to just plain angry. Sarcasm “appears to stimulate complex thinking and to attenuate the otherwise negative effects of anger,” according to the study authors. The mental gymnastics needed to perceive sarcasm includes developing a “theory of mind” to see beyond the literal meaning of the words and understand that the speaker may be thinking of something entirely different. A theory of mind allows you to realize that when your brother says “nice job” when you spill the milk, he means just the opposite, the jerk.', 'They not only have great minds, they have thick skin\nSarcastic people are smart enough not to take everything to heart. This means they don’t burst out into tears when you are teasing each other over being tipsy after a few beers. They can throw the punches as well as take them. You rarely find them playing the victim in the situation, because let’s face it, no one likes a victim. 6. They have healthier brains\nAccording to researchers at the University of California San Francisco and Neuropsychologist Katherine Rankin, the lack of ability to pick up on sarcasm can be an early warning sign of brain damage. It was found in a study that subjects with Fronto-Temporal Dementia had difficulty picking up on sarcasm. Advertising\n7. They make their friends and significant others smarter\nDue to their constant way of communicating, sarcastic people affect the brains of the people around them. There are three stages our brains need to take to understand irony.', 'Simply put, it’s because the tone and content oppose each other. A sincere comment in a positive tone—“That is so original!”—or a critical comment in a negative tone—“That is so cliche""—are congruent. A sarcastic comment, however, is often a positive message with a negative tone—“Wow, that’s original!”—which is more complicated for the brain to process. This doesn\'t mean sarcastic people are smarter, despite what some Internet articles might want you to believe. Now, this doesn\'t mean sarcastic people are smarter, despite what some Internet articles might want you to believe. It simply means that the ability to use and understand sarcasm requires a skill called Theory of Mind, which is the ability to detect the mental states of others, including their true feelings, thoughts, and intentions. So even though what is said is the opposite of what is meant, the sarcastic individual intends the listener to detect the true meaning. That’s why those with deficits in Theory of Mind—like people with schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, or autism—have a hard time understanding or using sarcasm. Now that we interact with each other on the Internet as much as (or perhaps more than) we do in person, we have to take our sarcasm detection skills up a notch, since many web-based communications don’t include tone. Researchers have even developed algorithms to detect sarcastic Tweets, with some even using emojis.', 'Rather than consider an argument on it\'s merits, a sarcastic response says ""I am too good for this"". Ironically, many people who consider themselves ""open minded"" use sarcasm with regularity to dismiss ideas which don\'t fit their worldview. Often, sarcastic people are under the mistaken impression that others believe their dismissive attitude is a sign of intelligence simply because they are too polite to tell them how much of a negative ass they are. These people generally try very hard to seem intelligent on the outside - they might even wear large-framed glasses that they don\'t need. Highly sarcastic individuals, in my opinion, are not desirable to be around. They tend to have no sympathy for any other humans. Their most common form of conversation tends to be putting other people down, and they almost never create original ideas. All in all, they seem pretty miserable. And for the purpose of this argument, I define ""highly sarcastic"" as someone who uses sarcasm as a response to almost any new concept or idea. Most of us will use sarcasm from time to time, but these people take it to a new level.']";"The passage indicates that the use of sarcasm, especially among individuals who use it frequently, is associated with good cognitive function and brain health. It explains that understanding and generating sarcasm requires complex brain processes, including the development of a ""theory of mind,"" which assists in realizing the deeper meanings behind sarcastic remarks. Furthermore, research highlighted in the passage suggests that sarcasm might even sharpen the brain, as evidenced by studies where subjects showed enhanced problem-solving capabilities when exposed to sarcastic comments. These aspects suggest that individuals who instinctively use sarcasm to tackle frivolous questions generally exhibit signs of healthy cognitive functions.";['Sarcasm can mask insecurity or aggression.', 'Context is key to interpreting sarcasm.', 'Overuse of sarcasm harms relationships.', 'Instinctive sarcasm signals quick wit.', 'Frequent sarcasm might indicate emotional issues.', 'Sarcasm use should consider recipient sensitivity.', 'Benevolent sarcasm links to higher intelligence.', 'Sarcasm enhances creative problem-solving.', 'Sarcasm is a double-edged sword.', 'Sarcasm understanding indicates high intelligence.', 'Healthy minds use sarcasm judiciously.', 'Sarcasm: complex, context-dependent communication.', 'Detrimental sarcasm reduces relationship quality.', 'Self-enhancing humor improves well-being.', 'Aggressive humor links to reduced well-being.'];['okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital'];['not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.7142857142857143

It described this as ""a clean-break Brexit"", more commonly known as a "" no-deal Brexit "". Generally described as populist, it drew its support from those who were frustrated with the delayed implementation of the 2016 referendum decision, and wished to leave the EU without remaining part of the EU\'s Single Market or Customs Union.

There have also been some endorsements from left-wing supporters of Brexit, such as former Respect Party MP George Galloway, as well as from former members of the Revolutionary Communist Party such as former Brexit Party MEP Claire Fox. The Brexit Party styled itself as being focused on the restoration of Britain\'s democratic sovereignty. On contesting the 2019 European Parliament election, it became the largest party in the UK contingent.

But rather than taking responsibility for her decisions or faulting the culture that demanded that women choose between love and work, she blamed feminists for daring women to dream. She accused them of falsely telling women they were the equals of men; that they had a right to be whomever they wished to be. She chastised feminists for disparaging women’s “noble” calling as housewives and mothers and urging women to take their place on the political stage. Instead, she argued that women did not have the capacity to achieve greatness in men’s world and implored them to stay at home, raise their families, and leave politics and industry to men. But in arguing against women’s equality and for their return to the home, Ida Tarbell repudiated her own accomplishments. Did she not see the inconsistency between her life and her words? Or was she unable to face it?

The first phenomenon was the rise of an anti-male feminist faction, comprised of many women who came from abusive relationships with men and harbored understandable anger. Then came the denial, mainly from white, well-educated, upper-class feminists, that race and class play a formative role in womanhood. These women focused their attention on the white-collar work world, leaving masses of working class and impoverished women behind. To top it off, feminism scared many people away by undervaluing love and becoming overtly academic. Mass media capitalized on these missteps to label feminists as ""man-haters."" The media amplified anti-male feminists and portrayed them as the feminist archetype. As bell hooks note, ""Conservative mass media constantly represented feminist women as man-haters. And when there was an anti-male faction or sentiment in the movement, they highlighted it as a way of discrediting feminism...Feminists who called for a recognition of men as comrades in struggle never received mass media attention."" But contrary to common perception, feminism embraces men.', 'Many people believe that feminists want to control the world and put men down. 4. Many people fear that feminism will overturn time-honored traditions, religious beliefs and established gender roles, and that feels scary and wrong. 5. Many people fear that feminism will bring about negative shifts in relationships, marriage, society, culture, power and authority dynamics, and in business, job and economic opportunities if and when women are on an equal footing with men. What about sexuality – what does that have to do with feminism? In reading about the media uproar over Emma Watson’s baring a bit of her breasts in Vanity Fair this month, we see that women are fighting among themselves about what feminism is and how women should behave if they’re true feminists. Emma (and Gloria Steinem) make a powerful point – feminism at its core is about choice. Feminists can wear whatever they want. If we cannot choose freely how to behave, speak, act and present ourselves, then we’re moving backwards.']";The passage suggests that some women may indeed have regrets or mixed feelings about embracing feminism, primarily influenced by broader societal reactions and internal conflicts. Ida Tarbell, for instance, expressed regret over the choices feminism encouraged, blaming it for leading women to aspire beyond traditional roles, which she eventually argued against despite her own professional successes. Additionally, modern perceptions of feminism are influenced by negative stereotypes, such as being seen as overly aggressive or anti-men, which has led to some women distancing themselves from the label.

Furthermore, I am not advocating you go through the National Board Certification process.', ""What to Do With Reflections\nReflecting on what went right and wrong with lessons and units—and classroom situations in general—is one thing. However, figuring out what to do with that information is quite another. Time spent in reflection can help ensure that this information can be used to produce real change and for growth to occur. There are several ways teachers can use the information they learned about themselves through reflection. They can: Reflect on their successes, find reasons to celebrate, and use these reflections to recommend actions they need to take to ensure success for students in next year's lessons; Individually or collectively reflect on areas that need improvement and look for areas where lessons did not have the desired academic impact; Reflect on any housekeeping issues that arose or areas where classroom management needed some work. Reflection is an ongoing process and someday the evidence may provide more specific guidelines for teachers. Reflection as a practice in education is evolving, and so are teachers.""]";Yes, a teacher's self-reflections can change over time. The passage illustrates how teachers evolve from potentially rushed, less reflective practitioners into more introspective and effective educators as indicated by the shift from the teacher's early days to her experience with the National Board Certification Process. This transformation is encouraged by both the changing dynamics of education and the recognition that personal and professional growth is necessary. Teachers are advised to use their reflective insights to adapt teaching methods, celebrate successes, and address areas of improvement, which all change as they gain more experience and respond to the evolving educational environment.;['Teacher self-reflection evolves with experience.', 'Reflection content shifts from basic skills to complex issues.', 'Changes in beliefs and pedagogy influence reflection.', 'Reflection improves teaching effectiveness and student learning.', 'Reflection adapts to changing student needs and curriculum.', 'Experienced teachers reflect on broader pedagogical issues.', 'Early reflections focus on classroom management.', 'Later reflections address deeper pedagogical concerns.', 'Peer feedback enhances self-reflection effectiveness.', 'Student feedback and data analysis improve reflection quality.', 'Self-assessment is crucial for professional development.', 'Reflection helps teachers identify strengths and weaknesses.', 'Timely reflection is more insightful than delayed reflection.', 'Reflection is an ongoing process of continuous improvement.', 'E-learning tools support self-reflection and professional growth.', 'Teachers adjust instruction based on reflective insights.', 'Reflection identifies areas for improvement and informs goal setting.', 'Engaging with colleagues broadens teaching perspectives.', 'Theoretical literature extends understanding of teaching practices.'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.75

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign received only 162 individual contributions from AARP members, but they averaged $270, for a total of $43,636. While the AARP PAC’s contributions reflect the partisan preferences of the organization’s employees, its membership is likely much more balanced. An Associated Press survey in 2018 found that 49 percent of voters 65 years of age or older voted Republican, compared with 48 percent for Democrats. Among voters between the ages of 50 and 64, 49 percent voted for Democrats, while 46 percent backed Republicans.', 'At the same time, the organization is incredibly politically active. In the past two elections, eight members of its 22-member board of directors have given significant contributions to presidential candidates, congressional candidates, and other political action committees and organizations, according to Federal Election Commission records.

Since 2007, AARP board members have given almost exclusively to Democrats, with more than 97 percent of donations going to Democrat candidates and left-leaning causes, totaling over $22,000. None was given to Republican candidates during that time. In fact, two board members, Jeannine English and Ronald Daly, both maxed out with $4,600 donations to Barack Obama. Diane Pratt gave Obama $2,000 (she also gave $1,000 to Hillary Clinton). To be fair, board member Jacob Lozada gave $2,000 of donations to the Republican National Committee in the early 2000’s. And according to followthemoney.org, AARP gave donations totaling tens of thousands of dollars to Republican state committees in 2007 and 2008. While there is no inherent corruption in making political donations, what the donations made by AARP’s policy-making board do reveal are at least the ideological bent many of its board members.', 'However, contributions from individuals who work for AARP is another matter. “AARP does not have any record of direct contributions to political parties or candidates based on my review of federal campaign finance and tax filings covering recent years, but AARP’s officers [executives] and employees can still make political donations in a personal capacity, and contributions from donors listing AARP as their employer in Federal Election Commission records have primarily gone to Democratic candidates in recent years,” said Anna Massoglia, a researcher for The Center for Responsive Politics. AARP policy prohibits employees or officers from engaging in any personal political activity using AARP resources or during work hours. According to campaign finance data tracked by Open Secrets, individual donors associated with AARP made a total of $96,381 in political contributions as of this writing in the 2020 federal election cycle, the majority (87.45%) of those donations going to Democratic candidates. Massoglia said that as a 501 (c)4 organization, the AARP is allowed under U.S. tax code to engage in some political campaign activity. But their activities have been issue-oriented and bipartisan. For example, a 2018 AARP ad praised U.S. President Donald Trump on drug pricing policy. The organization has also supported upholding the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health care law signed by Trump’s Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama. AARP spokesperson Jason Young told us by phone that the organization, as a 501 (c)4 non-profit, is prohibited by law from making political contributions. “ Not only does AARP not make donations of this sort, we never have and we don’t have a PAC,” Young added.', 'AARP Is Officially Nonpartisan but Group Officials’ Money Mostly Goes to Dems\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Sen.

AARP has no official party affiliations although donation records and patterns show steep favoritism for the Democratic Party.

Instead, spearheads supporting AARP’s blatant abuse of non-profit designation frequently occur within Congress. When Bush attempted reforming the Social Security system, AARP worked through lobbyists, committees, and Democratic funding to achieve the proposition’s dismissal. The Iron Triangle between the House Committee on Aging, the Social Security Administration, and AARP exemplifies governmental corruption via corporate special interests. While any American has the right “to petition the government for redress of grievances,” a majority of lobbyists have corporate or special interest backing.

Quantum computers however, are not limited to binary, instead everything is both “1” and “0” until it is observed (as they use the phenomena of “quantum superposition”). In the quantum world (the very small sub-atomic world) particles like quarks, electrons, and photons can exist in more than one place at a time (a state of superposition). If we look for a particle in one place it will be there, if we look in another place it will be there, and if we don’t look it will exist in more than one place at the same time. Given the above, the observer effect refers to the fact that when we actually try to observe (measure) a particle like an electron it’s behavior will change based on our observation. Recent findings are hinting that this is a problem with the way we have been measuring and not something more mystical.

Physicists have found that even passive observation of quantum phenomena (by changing the test apparatus and passively ""ruling out"" all but one possibility) can actually change the measured result. Despite the ""observer"" in this experiment being an electronic detector—possibly due to the assumption that the word ""observer"" implies a person—its results have led to the popular belief that a conscious mind can directly affect reality. The need for the ""observer"" to be conscious is not supported by scientific research, and has been pointed out as a misconception rooted in a poor understanding of the quantum wave function ψ and the quantum measurement process, apparently being the generation of information at its most basic level that produces the effect.

It is possible for other, less direct means of measurement to affect the electron. It is also necessary to distinguish clearly between the measured value of a quantity and the value resulting from the measurement process. In particular, a measurement of momentum is non-repeatable in short intervals of time.

The quantum mechanical observer is tied to the issue of observer effect, where a measurement necessarily requires interacting with the physical object being measured, affecting its properties through the interaction. The term ""observable"" has gained a technical meaning, denoting a Hermitian operator that represents a measurement. The prominence of seemingly subjective or anthropocentric ideas like ""observer"" in the early development of the theory has been a continuing source of disquiet and philosophical dispute. A number of new-age religious or philosophical views give the observer a more special role, or place constraints on who or what can be an observer. There is no credible peer-reviewed research that backs such claims. As an example of such claims, Fritjof Capra declared, ""The crucial feature of atomic physics is that the human observer is not only necessary to observe the properties of an object, but is necessary even to define these properties."" The Copenhagen interpretation, which is the most widely accepted interpretation of quantum mechanics among physicists, posits that an ""observer"" or a ""measurement"" is merely a physical process. One of the founders of the Copenhagen interpretation, Werner Heisenberg, wrote: Of course the introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to imply that some kind of subjective features are to be brought into the description of nature.', 'The observer has, rather, only the function of registering decisions, i.e., processes in space and time, and it does not matter whether the observer is an apparatus or a human being; but the registration, i.e., the transition from the ""possible"" to the ""actual,"" is absolutely necessary here and cannot be omitted from the interpretation of quantum theory. Niels Bohr, also a founder of the Copenhagen interpretation, wrote: all unambiguous information concerning atomic objects is derived from the permanent marks such as a spot on a photographic plate, caused by the impact of an electron left on the bodies which define the experimental conditions. Far from involving any special intricacy, the irreversible amplification effects on which the recording of the presence of atomic objects rests rather remind us of the essential irreversibility inherent in the very concept of observation. The description of atomic phenomena has in these respects a perfectly objective character, in the sense that no explicit reference is made to any individual observer and that therefore, with proper regard to relativistic exigencies, no ambiguity is involved in the communication of information. Likewise, Asher Peres stated that ""observers"" in quantum physics are\nsimilar to the ubiquitous ""observers"" who send and receive light signals in special relativity. Obviously, this terminology does not imply the actual presence of human beings. These fictitious physicists may as well be inanimate automata that can perform all the required tasks, if suitably programmed. Critics of the special role of the observer also point out that observers can themselves be observed, leading to paradoxes such as that of Wigner\'s friend;']";Yes, an observer does make a significant difference in the quantum world, primarily due to the quantum measurement problem and the observer effect. In quantum mechanics, the act of observing (or measuring) a quantum system inevitably alters its state. For example, in the double-slit experiment, attempting to detect which slit a particle passes through disrupts the interference pattern, demonstrating how measurement affects the particle's wave-like and particle-like behaviors. This impact of observation highlights the fundamental role of measurement in defining the properties of quantum systems, where even non-conscious entities like electronic detectors can serve as observers. Thus, the observer's role is crucial in determining the behavior and the resulting measurement of quantum entities.;['Observation changes quantum outcomes', 'Measurement disturbs quantum systems', 'Superposition collapses upon measurement', 'Wave function collapses upon interaction', 'Interaction, not consciousness, causes collapse', 'Any interaction constitutes observation', 'Quantum properties depend on measurement', 'Observer effect is a physical process', 'Conscious observer not strictly necessary', 'Many-worlds interpretation: no collapse', 'Quantum Zeno effect: observation slows decay', 'Entanglement: non-local correlations', 'Quantum reality is observer-dependent', 'Objects exist with real properties if observed', 'Quantum tunneling demonstrates superposition', 'Quantum systems exist as possibilities', 'Actualization upon observation', 'Observation creates reality', 'The act of measuring alters the system', 'Heisenberg uncertainty principle: observer influence'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay'];['support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support'];0.8

In 2010, the Pew Research Center asked respondents to rate the importance of various factors when choosing a mate, and found that black women have high aspirations. Asked how important it is that a “good husband or partner provide a good income,” two thirds of black women said it is very important, compared to 32% of white women.

Men with such ideal characteristics are especially hard to find in low-income minority communities. A highly acclaimed study by sociologists Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas found that low-income black and Latina mothers value marriage highly but see many financial barriers, because potential partners often have very low incomes and may be unemployed. Similarly, sociologists William Julius Wilson and Kathryn Neckerman found that high unemployment was associated with low rates of marriage; and another study using data from 1990 to 2009 found that a dearth of men with attractive social characteristics was, in fact, associated with high rates of families headed by women.', 'The most obvious is that, assuming marriages or cohabitation mostly occur within racial groups, black women’s family position is damaged directly or indirectly by the poor outcomes for black men.

Equally, if black women are more likely than white women to end up as single, they will also record a lower family income. We set out to model the impact of household formation by artificially equalizing the marriage rates of black women and white women. The results will of course depend not just on whether they marry, but also on whom they marry. In our simulation, we assume that the additional women who are married have a husband with the same economic characteristics as their brother (see the Technical Paper for our detailed methods).

Finally, a truly innovative study by Kristen Harknett and Sara McLanahan simultaneously tested cultural and socioeconomic explanations. Even though black women in this study had the strongest pro-marriage attitudes, the high ratio of black women to men and an undersupply of employed black men fully explained the lower likelihood of marriage for black women. To Boost Marriage, Help Black Men\nThose who want to boost marriage rates among blacks should focus on improving job opportunities and education for black men. In 2010, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 18.4% of black men were jobless compared to 9.6% of white men. Black men also earn lower wages than similar white men.', 'black men do poorly on both counts. Black women do reasonably well on the first and very poorly on the second. This result is probably driven by the fact that black women tend to create families with black men who do poorly on both counts and thus bring down the family income results for black women. Lower marriage rates aren’t hurting black mobility\nWhy? Various explanations could be given. The most obvious is that, assuming marriages or cohabitation mostly occur within racial groups, black women’s family position is damaged directly or indirectly by the poor outcomes for black men. If white women end up with white men, who in terms of their earnings are more than twice as likely to escape poverty as black men, their family income will be higher.

Social and Economic Barriers to Marriage\nEver since Moynihan presented his argument, other scholars have accumulated considerable evidence that social and economic impediments to marriage matter more than value orientations. Aspirations are not the issue, in this view, so much as a dearth of what William Julius Wilson calls “marriageable” black men. In part, the men are just not there in many black communities. Mortality rates are high for black men, and black men are also very often imprisoned. In 2010, 4,347 out of every 100,000 black men were in prison, a rate that was six times higher than the imprisonment rate for white men.

According to the Pew Research Center’s findings in 2010, two-thirds of black women deem it very important that a good husband or partner provide a good income. This contrasts with only 32% of white women considering it very important. Given these preferences, coupled with the socioeconomic disparities and higher unemployment rates among black men compared to white men, black women might be incentivized to marry outside their race, particularly to white men who statistically have better economic prospects.

Where Did the Minimalist Design Trend Come From? Minimalism was a rejection of the extremely subjective designs and works of abstract expressionism. By distilling a product, painting or subject down to its bare essentials, minimalists wanted to showcase its true form. Abstract expressionism is an approach to design that combines self-denial and emotional intensity, which produces designs that some see as chaotic, rebellious, and even nihilistic. Unsurprisingly, spontaneity (or at least the impression thereof) is the main feature of abstract expressionism. Minimalism, in stark contrast, takes form, color, and space and reduces them to such simplicity to attain their essential nature. At this point, the philosophy goes, one can’t remove anything else from the design to improve it further in any way, shape or form. That’s when you know that true minimalism has been reached.

America became its homeland. The main features of minimalism are the simplicity of forms of expression, as well as a literal, objective approach. The forerunners of minimalism in the painting can reasonably be called Kazimir Malevich with his “Black Square”. Here he reached an apotheosis in simplification of color and form.

In its most stripped-down definition, minimalism is about designers expressing only the most essential and necessary elements of a product or subject by getting rid of any excessive and, therefore, unnecessary components and features. As with many other movements, the minimalist design trend is a reaction to and rejection of an earlier design philosophy that fell out of favor. Minimalism is all around us. You can see it anywhere from the user interface of your favorite website or app to the package design of your latest gift and the design on the cup of your favorite cup of coffee. Here’s a look at minimalism, its history, and some stunning examples of this design movement. Where Did the Minimalist Design Trend Come From? Minimalism was a rejection of the extremely subjective designs and works of abstract expressionism. By distilling a product, painting or subject down to its bare essentials, minimalists wanted to showcase its true form. Abstract expressionism is an approach to design that combines self-denial and emotional intensity, which produces designs that some see as chaotic, rebellious, and even nihilistic.']";Yes, minimalism does come from creativity, though in a restrained and focused manner. The movement originated as a response to the highly subjective and emotionally charged style of abstract expressionism. By reducing forms, colors, and designs to their simplest expressions, minimalists sought to expose the true essence of an object, thereby applying a creative philosophy that emphasizes simplicity and objectivity. This method reflects a deliberate and thoughtful approach to creativity, where every element included is crucial, showing that creativity in minimalism is about achieving purity rather than complexity.;"['Minimalism: creative expression through restraint', 'Minimalism requires creativity, skill, discipline', 'Minimalism: less is more; requires creative problem-solving', 'Minimalism: powerful simplicity, requires effort', 'Minimalism: a creative approach to problem-solving', 'Minimalism: essential elements for maximum impact', 'Minimalism: clean aesthetic, ""less is more""', 'Minimalism: simple expression of complex thought', 'Minimalism: simplicity can foster creativity', 'Minimalism started in creative fields (art, design)', 'Minimalism: reaction against excess, abstract expressionism', 'Minimalism: combines form and function', 'Minimalism: function dictates form', 'Minimalism: adapts to different eras', 'Minimalism: influenced by Bauhaus, Japanese Zen', 'Minimalism: rebellion against consumerism', 'Postminimalism: focus shifts from idea to conveyance', 'Minimalism: bold, show-stopping pieces', 'Minimalism: de-mystifies art, reveals fundamental character', 'Minimalism: influential style across media', 'Minimalist design: creative, imaginative use of space', 'Minimalism: born from artistic movements of the 1960s']";['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital'];['support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support'];0.8

Anecdotal evidence and faulty logic\nAnecdotal evidence is often unscientific or pseudoscientific because various forms of cognitive bias may affect the collection or presentation of evidence. For instance, someone who claims to have had an encounter with a supernatural being or alien may present a very vivid story, but this is not falsifiable. This phenomenon can also happen to large groups of people through subjective validation . Anecdotal evidence is also frequently misinterpreted via the availability heuristic, which leads to an overestimation of prevalence. Where a cause can be easily linked to an effect, people overestimate the likelihood of that the cause does have that effect (availability). In particular, vivid, emotionally-charged anecdotes seem more plausible, and are given greater weight. A related issue is that it is usually impossible to assess for every piece of anecdotal evidence, the rate of people not reporting that anecdotal evidence in the population. A common way anecdotal evidence becomes unscientific is through fallacious reasoning such as the post hoc fallacy, the human tendency to assume that if one event happens after another, then the first must be the cause of the second. Another fallacy involves inductive reasoning.', 'Anecdotal Evidence\na. Provides weak support for an argument\nb. Acts as a powerful counterexample for dismissing an argument\nc. Describes one, or a few best instances all of the same type, general nature, or structure\nAn anecdote is a spec i fic example, usually grounded in personal, secondary, or incomplete evidence. Obviously an anecdote cannot prove a general statement, so avoid treating a single case as proving a general point. An anecdote is especially unconvincing when it is a broad example being used to support or oppose a very narrow claim. And a single anecdote or counterexample is alone sufficient to disprove a general statement. A well-chosen anecdote, however, can be a counter-example that demonstrates how a claim must be modified or qualified. Anecdotal evidence often appears in journalism, or in short essays like book reviews or public scholarship where a writer wants to undermine someone else’s claim. 2. Testimonial Evidence\na.

Misuse of anecdotal evidence is a logical fallacy and is sometimes informally referred to as the ""person who"" fallacy (""I know a person who...""; "" I know of a case where..."" etc.) The problem with arguing based on anecdotal evidence is that anecdotal evidence is not necessarily typical; only statistical evidence can determine how typical something is.

This might include businesses where nude or semi-nude dancing occurs, where adult movies are shown or sold, or where sexually orientated products are sold. The rationale that city officials use is called the secondary effects doctrine. Under this doctrine, city officials do not regulate adult businesses because they engage in offensive, unpopular expression, but because the businesses cause adverse secondary effects, such as increased crime and decreased property values. Communities have attempted to use zoning laws to prevent adult entertainment businesses from operating within their borders. However, in decisions such as Sable Communications of California v. Federal Communications Commission (1989) the Court stated that “Sexual expression which is indecent but not obscene is protected by the First Amendment,” and government cannot totally restrict efforts to access this type of speech or communication. Thus, in cases such as Schad v. Mount Ephraim (1981) the Supreme Court ruled that while zoning may create adult zones or limit the placement of adult entertainment businesses within a community, the community may not zone them out completely or restrict them to small and highly inaccessible areas.

The Court further developed this doctrine in City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.

In Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. (1991), the Court upheld an ordinance (not a zoning law) that required nude dancers to wear pasties or g-strings. Here the Court, relying on the logic of Young and Renton, asserted that totally nude dancing was only marginally protected by the First Amendment and therefore could be regulated.

For example, a community may wish to zone some areas for residential homes and others for manufacturing to prevent a factory from being built in the middle of an area full of homes. In Buchanan v. Warley (1917), the Court struck down a city law segregating neighborhoods by race as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, effectively making it unconstitutional to use zoning for racially discriminatory purposes. However, in Eucid v. Ambler Reality (1926) the U.S. Supreme Court upheld zoning as a valid use of a state or local government’s police power. Individuals have also successfully challenged zoning laws that were so onerous or burdensome that they effected an uncompensated taking of property contrary to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.

The city of Renton, Washington, passed an adult-business zoning law in 1981 that prevented adult businesses, like the Renton theater pictured here, from locating within 1,000 feet of any residential area, school, park, or church.

External factors, meanwhile, are the ones that aren't directly in the company's control, like the economy and your employees' personal life circumstances. Compensation and Advancement\nPerhaps the clearest internal motivator on an employee's behavior is whether she feels the company pays her what her work is worth and provides her with the opportunities for career advancement that she has earned. That's because income and career prospects are vital to a person's livelihood, and so can profoundly motivate behavior. If the company falls short on either pay or promotion, an employee may begin to suspect the company is taking advantage of her -- especially if she sees her colleagues getting better treatment. You can stop this from taking root by making it clear to an employee early on exactly how she can demonstrate her worth, and then giving her the opportunity to do so.

These factors include economic conditions, political climates, technological advancements, and societal trends. For instance, economic fluctuations can impact job security, wage structures, and organizational budgets, forcing adjustments in employee roles and responsibilities. Political changes may lead to new regulations or laws that a company and its employees must comply with, altering working conditions or operational priorities. Similarly, advances in technology can require employees to acquire new skills to handle upgraded systems or processes. Additionally, societal expectations can drive organizations to adopt more sustainable or ethical practices, influencing job roles and organizational culture.

Hereditary diseases, also known as inherited diseases or genetic disorders, are diseases that are passed on from one generation to another through defective genes. These diseases are transmitted in the same family. In some cases, one generation of the family may only be the carrier of the defective gene and the next generation may get affected by the disease. The chromosomes in humans are responsible for passing the traits from the parent to the offspring. There are thousands of genes on the pair of chromosomes, X and Y, and each gene carries a trait. Usually genes carry normal traits but sometimes due to reasons unknown, the genes get altered resulting in a ‘mutant’ gene. The offspring inherits a copy of gene from each parent and if either one or both the copies of gene are mutated, then the offspring is at a risk of getting an inherited disease.

Back\r\nto Main Page  |  Bibliography\nBy Gary T. Marx\nDemocracy is defined by broad\r\nvalues involving participation and formal rules about procedures such as\r\nelections. But for most persons most of the time these are removed from\r\ndaily life. That is not true for the police, the agency of government that\r\ncitizens are most likely to see and have contact with. All industrial societies\r\nuse police to control crime and to contribute to public order (e.g., mediating\r\nand arbitrating disputes, regulating traffic and helping in emergencies). But the conditions under which police operate, the means they use and the\r\nends they seek vary greatly between democratic and non-democratic societies. Police are a central element\r\nof a democratic society. Indeed one element in defining such a society\r\nis a police force that 1) is subject to the rule of law, rather than the\r\nwishes of a powerful leader or party 2) can intervene n the life of citizens\r\nonly under limited and carefully controlled circumstances and 3) is publicly\r\naccountable. It is a myth that all that\r\nstands between total chaos and social order is the police. Social order\r\nhas multiple sources.', 'It also offers great temptations for abuse. Law\r\nenforcement requires a delicate balancing act. The conflicts between liberty\r\nand order receive their purest expression in considerations of democratic\r\npolicing. It is ironic that police\r\nare both a major support and a major threat to a democratic society. When\r\npolice operate under the rule of law they may protect democracy by their\r\nexample of respect for the law and by suppressing crime. Police are moral,\r\nas well as legal, actors. But apart from the rule of\r\nlaw and public accountability, the police power to use force, engage in\r\nsummary punishment, use covert surveillance, and to stop, search and arrest\r\ncitizens, can be used to support dictatorial regimes and practices. When\r\nnon-democratic regimes are toppled a prominent demand is always for the\r\nelimination of the secret police. The term ""police state"" as represented\r\nby Germany under National Socialism and the former Soviet Union under communism\r\nsuggests the opposite of a democratic state. Police are subservient to\r\na single party, not a legislature or judiciary.', 'Their purpose must not be to enforce political\r\nconformity. Holding unpopular beliefs or behaving in unconventional, yet\r\nlegal, ways are not adequate grounds for interfering with citizen’s liberty. When opponents of democracy operate within the law police have an obligation\r\nto protect their rights, as well as the rights of others. In an important sense a democratic\r\npolice is a neutral police. For example in a racial or labor disturbance\r\npolice are not to take sides, nor should they spy on, or disrupt the legal\r\nactions of an opposition political party. Democratic societies strive\r\nfor equal law enforcement. Citizens are to be treated in equivalent ways. Police are trained to behave in a universalistic fashion. Should their\r\npersonal attitude depart from the demands of the role they are playing,\r\nthis must not effect their behavior. Police show neutrality if they simply\r\nenforce the rules regardless of the characteristics of the persons or group\r\ninvolved (e.g., their race or social class).']";Democratic values are best demonstrated by the police through strict adherence to the rule of law and respect for human rights, ensuring that their actions and interventions are limited and carefully controlled under established legal standards. Officers must conduct their duties with impartiality, treating all community members equally without discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, or other characteristics, thereby upholding the principles of equality and justice central to democracy.

The report also showed that 50% of self-reported suicide attempts in graduate school are made by STEM graduate students. Can you believe that? Again…\n50% of self-reported suicide attempts are made by STEM PhD candidates. Why is getting a PhD so stressful today? The reason is simple— academia is a dead-end. STEM graduate students are very intelligent, hard-working, and ambitious individuals. These individuals have given everything to academia and are only now realizing that academia has nothing to offer them in return.', 'The payments just… keep going up and up and up and up… until you die,” one replies. These young people are not alone — not by a long shot. According to a recent survey of current and former students between 20 and 39 years of age, 70 percent of them were $100K to $500K in debt. Because of this burden,\nOne in 11 deaths by suicide among young professionals was at least partly due to student loans; One in 15 has contemplated suicide; Over half (53 percent) have experienced depression; Nine in 10 experienced significant anxiety.

More than 70 percent reported suffering from headaches, insomnia, and other physical symptoms of anxiety, which sometimes lead to self-imposed social isolation. Advertisement: “I avoid doing things with friends and family,” one respondent said, “because I don’t want them to know how broke I am.” “Student loan–induced stress is threatening to take over the lives of borrowers,” the survey concludes. Student loans are pulling down the US economy — this is no longer news. Americans now spend substantially more than students in other developed countries for a college education, at an average of $30,000 per student annually. Borrowing has almost doubled over the past decade. By the end of 2018, the US had more than 44.7 million student borrowers, across all demographics and age groups, who collectively have amassed $1.56 trillion in debt, according to the US Federal Reserve. While the macroeconomic crisis of student loans has become a heated topic in the political arena, little attention is paid to the real-life crises faced by debtors themselves.', 'A study by El-Ghoroury and colleagues published in Training and Education in Professional Psychology ® last year found that debt and other financial issues were No. 2 on the list of both student stressors and barriers to self-care, just after academic responsibilities or pressures. But student debt doesn\'t just hurt students, says El-Ghoroury. It also hurts psychology as a whole, he says. ""Psychology is enriched by having students from all types of backgrounds,"" says El-Ghoroury. "" It would be a real loss if graduate study became too unaffordable for some students."" That\'s already happening, says Avellar, who believes departments should limit the number of students they admit to those they can support and seek creative solutions such as private donations from community members. Graduate education is becoming a luxury item, says Avellar. He points to the federal government\'s 2012 decision to eliminate graduate students\' eligibility for subsidized student loans, a decision that will hit low-income students the hardest. The result, he says, will be that graduate school becomes the domain of students who already have the most advantages, such as wealthy parents. ""', 'This is not the first research on the mental toll of student loans. Over the past few years, many researchers have correlated student debt with poor psychological functioning. However, it is a topic virtually ignored by the media. A 2015 study found that the link between student loans and mental and emotional dysfunction persists across all income and social groups in the US. And at least one study revealed the physical and social effects of debt-related stress. In 2017, a financial advising company called Student Loan Hero did a survey of over 1,000 student borrowers.

The financial strain is linked to mental health issues, as evidenced by a report that notes a remarkable percentage of graduate students experiencing emotional or stress-related problems.

Colored people who commit the same crimes are not treated the same way as white people would be. Our prison system has many problems and is in desperate need of reform. Some of these problems include inhumane living conditions, racial bias, and increased risk of reincarceration. We can solve these problems if we meet three requirements of an effective system. Firstly, the punishment has to fit the crime. Secondly, it has to do more harm than good. And, thirdly similar crimes should be sentenced in the same way.', 'In the same way, unlike white children, black children are 2.5 times more likely to be arrested due to curfew breach. Children of African-Americans are twice as likely to be detained as white children. Furthermore, according to a study of the National Academy of Sciences, it is clear that blacks are more likely to be jailed than whites while waiting for their affairs to be heard. According to the survey, African Americans tend to be subject to imprisonment conditions instead of community service, unlike white-American Americans. This explains why more Americans are black than white people in prisons. The same goes for the use of physical force by the police while arresting black Americans. Once arrested, they are under a greater threat of being faced by mandatory sentencing charges. For example, blacks are twice more likely to face imprisonment instead of community service in contrast to the white Americans. Moreover, after completing their prison sentences, these people face great difficulty getting a job.

Whites then accounted for nearly 80 percent of those in prisons and jails compared to 36 percent today. The question of poverty alone may well account for many of the apparent inequalities in the system. A RAND Corporation study, however, unearthed some disturbing data. RAND compared the treatment of whites and blacks at key decision points in the criminal justice system. The researchers found that black defendants seemed to be treated more harshly at key points such as sentencing. But the researchers did not identify a cause for these inequalities. Later studies have provided more insight into this data. Arrest\nAfrican Americans accounted for more than a third of the arrests in 2010 for violent crimes. This far surpasses their numbers in the population.', 'the important factor here is the comparative proportion.) 19 white people and 24 black people might be sentenced to prison. Using the example felony incarceration rates cited above, we might expect to see 38% of the 50 convicted white defendants (19) and 51% of the 48 convicted black defendants (24) incarcerated for their crimes. In this scenario, 12% of black people who commit a crime and less than 2% of white people who commit the same crime might eventually go to prison. This example demonstrates that there are systemic differences in how blacks and whites are treated by the law. These differences, which are compounded in each successive phase of the criminal justice process, increase the percentage of black people incarcerated for committing a particular crime. This example is NOT meant to be a conclusive analysis explaining the incarceration gap. The statistics presented above and applied to the illustrative example come from different contexts and refer to different crimes. Racial disparities in the application of criminal justice are not the only source of differential incarceration rates. Poverty, geography, and lacking educational and career opportunities all likely play a role.'];The passage highlights several ways in which black individuals in the prison system are treated more harshly compared to their white counterparts. Firstly, black people are incarcerated at higher rates than white people for similar crimes, indicating a disparity in sentencing practices. For example, despite comparable rates of drug use, black individuals are imprisoned 10 times more frequently than white individuals. Secondly, the passage notes that black individuals are more likely to be jailed while awaiting trial and to receive harsher penalties, such as imprisonment instead of community service.

The U.S. had poured some $168 billion into the war, but the real cost of the conflict was its impact on the economy. After a few truly good years during 1962 – 1965 when there was low inflation, almost full employment and a favorable balance of trade, President Lyndon B. Johnson, who succeeded President Kennedy after his assassination in 1963, declared a “War on Poverty” through his “Great Society” programs while escalating the war in Vietnam at the same time. However, his decision to finance both “guns and butter” – a major war and the Great Society simultaneously, without a significant increase in taxes unleashed an acceleration of inflation peaking at a runaway double-digit in mid 1970s. Not until 1969 did President Johnson decided to introduce a 10% income tax surcharge, which is considered by many economists “too little and too late” and in turn also slowed down the economy. It’s worth mentioning that Congress would not allow that “surcharge” to be implemented until President Johnson agreed to cut $6 billion from domestic spending on Great Society programs. Despite their relative success, Johnson could have undoubtedly spent more on these programs had he not had to pay for the war abroad, which Martin Luther King, Jr. had referred to as a “America’s tragic distraction” at the beginning of Johnson administration. Moreover, huge spending on the war in Vietnam led to an increasingly unfavorable balance of trade, which contributed to an international monetary crisis and threat to U.S. gold reserves in 1967-68. That threat was seen as convincing evidence that the U.S. could no longer afford the war. Inflation fueled by the escalation of the Vietnam and later Yom Kippur War also increased food prices and contributed to the oil price hike in 1973, which then led to inflationary expectations.', ""Economic Impact - The Impact Of The Vietnam War\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\nphotos\nvideos\nHuman Impact\nPolitical Impact\nEconomic Impact\nChat\nThe Economic Impact.

For many economists, the last truly good years in the U.S. were 1962-65 when there was almost full employment, low inflation and a favorable balance of trade. During those years, farm price supports continued to prop up rural incomes and keep food prices low. But the escalation of the war fueled inflation and also increased food prices.

All three of these explanations are culprits for the increasing gap between the rich and the poor. In this article, I will breakdown each one of these factors and expand on why they’re helping to fuel the income inequality crisis. Globalization\nGlobalization is the expansion of goods, information, jobs, and technology around the globe. It has both its positives and negatives. It helps developing countries by increasing their access to products and services. It also helps underdeveloped countries modernize and gain better job opportunities. On the flipside, globalization can remove job opportunities in developed countries like the United States. This is because US companies can outsource their labor to other countries and pay much less in wages.

Over the last 60 years, technology has drastically changed the way of living in the US. The digitalization and augmentation of labor is diminishing job opportunities across the board. Those with a higher education are more sought after to operate or create the software and technology used in the modern world. Authors Dao, Das, Koczan, and Lian (2019) described in the World Economic Outlook by the International Monetary Fund that “In advanced economies, about half of the decline in labor shares can be traced to the impact of technology. The decline was driven by a combination of rapid progress in information and telecommunication technology, and a high share of occupations that could be easily be automated.” White-collar jobs that were once available for the less educated are disappearing as technology advances. Those that cannot afford a college education are left behind and have an even more difficult time finding lucrative occupations. On top of this, the valuations of US tech companies are breaking records.', 'A study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that globalization is directly increasing income inequality in the US. The study looked closely at the pay of top executives that benefit from globalized commerce. Researchers that took part in the study Wolfgang Keller and William W.

Corporations are often blamed for putting profits ahead of workers. But they must remain competitive. U.S. companies must compete with lower-priced Chinese and Indian companies who pay their workers much less. As a result, many companies have outsourced their high-tech and manufacturing jobs overseas. The United States has lost 36% of its factory jobs from 1980 to 2020. These were traditionally higher-paying union jobs.'];Outsourcing can contribute to income inequality through several mechanisms, as indicated in the passage. Firstly, it allows companies to cut costs by moving jobs to countries where labor is cheaper, which can lead to job losses in higher-wage countries like the United States. This displacement can reduce job opportunities and suppress wage growth domestically. Secondly, the savings garnered from outsourcing are often channeled towards increasing the incomes of top-level executives, amplifying pay disparities between executive and lower-level workers. Additionally, as companies maintain or enhance profitability through outsourcing, worker productivity may rise without a corresponding increase in wages, further contributing to income inequality. This creates a more pronounced disparity between the compensation of top executives and that of ordinary workers.;['Lower wages in developing countries', 'Increased corporate profits', 'Exploitation of foreign workers', 'Job losses in developed countries', 'Suppressed domestic wage growth', 'Wealth concentration among corporations', 'Increased competition for low-paying jobs', 'Job insecurity and reduced worker bargaining power', 'Wage stagnation despite increased productivity', 'Globalization exacerbates inequality', 'Reduced consumer spending', 'Strain on social safety nets'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.6666666666666666

When these phenomena are combined in urban areas, it can fuel social polarization. Urban decay is a visual manifestation of social polarization, while riots, civil commotion and general social disintegration can be symptomatic of this concept as well. However, it can also lead to an informal economy in many urban areas. Role of media\nDigital media, and particularly social media, could potentially play a role in encouraging social polarization. This is because social media sites like Facebook can help cluster friends and acquaintances into homophilous circles, and social news sites like Digg can facilitate a consumption of news that is biased by its user’s choices. In the extreme, a lack of “a common public sphere” could lead to isolated, polarized groups which could even be hostile towards one another. For example, during the Arab Spring uprisings, it was observed that social media furthered the social stratification already present in several Arab states.', 'People in favor of this said it was bringing back jobs to Americans and keeping illegal immigrants out. Opponents say it is an expensive idea that will damage our relationship with Mexico and won’t solve anything, if yet create problems. These topic have led to arguments and stories that talk about racism and can promote racism against minorities on social media. But to understand how social injustice is spread across social media, one has to look at the science behind it; that is the connection between social media and social injustice. During the 2016 election, Russian hackers posted an email from Hillary Clinton that claimed to be rigging the polls in Clinton’s favor. Looking further into the email, Timothy Lee says it was a tactic called oversampling that was collecting extra data about a particular group. Despite this, opponents of Clinton would scroll through social media and see this story and make assumptions that it was actually being rigged. What they wouldn’t notice is that the email was from 2008 and not 2016. This entire situation doesn’t only apply to Republicans though, as something similar could happen to liberal audiences.', 'One of the earlier stimulating research works on social polarization is from R.E. Pahl on Isle of Sheppey, wherein he provides a comparison between the Pre-capitalist society and capitalist society . More recently, a number of research projects have been increasingly addressing the issues of social polarization within the developed economies. When social polarization occurs in addition to economic restructuring, particularly in cities, economic inequality along social class and racial lines is exacerbated. Such separation can be best observed in the urban environment, “where [communities] of extreme wealth and social power are interspersed with places of deprivation, exclusion, and decline.” In addition to how spatial compositions are managed in cities, the technologies used in regards to social relations can also contribute to social polarization (see Social Polarization & The Media ). Increased spatial segregation of socioeconomic groups correlates strongly with social polarization as well as social exclusion and societal fragmentation.

Conversely, the process of creative destruction is intrinsically spatially uneven, so some urban neighborhoods “at the receiving end” of globalization are harmed by it. Urban poverty\nSeveral theoretical models can be strung together to explain the basics that create social polarization, and the subsequent deprivation that occurs when there is extreme societal deprivation between those of high-wealth and low-wealth.', 'What disparities did you find in the ways that social media use benefits and harms certain populations? What concerns does this raise? My co-authors Rachel McCloud, Vish Viswanath, and I found that the benefits and harms associated with social media use varied across demographic, socioeconomic, and racial population sub-groups. Specifically, while the benefits were generally associated with younger age, better education, and being white, the harms were associated with older age, less education, and being a racial minority. Indeed, these findings are consistent with the body of work on communication inequalities and health disparities that our lab, the Viswanath lab, has documented over the past 15 or so years. We know that education, income, race, and ethnicity influence people’s access to, and ability to act on, health information from media, including the Internet.

A burial ground in Campeche, Mexico, suggests slaves had been brought there not long after Hernán Cortés completed the subjugation of Aztec and Mayan Mexico. The first side of the triangle was the export of goods from Europe to Africa. A number of African kings and merchants took part in the trading of slaves from 1440 to about 1900. For each captive, the African rulers would receive a variety of goods from Europe. Many of them were confronted with the dilemma of trading with Europe or becoming slaves themselves. The second leg of the triangle exported enslaved Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to South America, the Carribean islands, and North America. Five times the number of slaves were transported to the Americas compared to those transports to Europe. This is because the slaves were exposed to new diseases and also because of malnutrition. The third and final part of the triangle was the return of goods to Europe from the Americas.', 'Twelve million Africans were captured in Africa with the intent to enter them into the slave trade. As slave labor was in high demand in the colonies, the triangular trade was lucrative for Europe, which allowed the trade to remain robust for centuries. The slave labor supplied to the colonies allowed for the proliferation of plantations, which in turn helped with the growth and prosperity of the New World. The triangular trade brought new crops and goods to Africa. African leaders took advantage of the economic benefits offered by the trade and willingly sold captives and prisoners of war to European traders. In general, though, historians believe that the slave trade irreparably harmed Africa. The trade caused a decline in the population, particularly the population of young men, which led to economic fragility. The continent fell far behind the growth of the developing world, opening it up to European colonization in the 19th century. What are some historical people related to the Triangular Trade? Sir John Hawkins:', 'At that time, there was no concept of being African – identity and loyalty were based on kinship or membership of a specific kingdom or society, rather than to the African continent. States based on slavery grew in power and influence. For example the Kingdom of Dahomey became one of the most prosperous nations: total receipts from slave exports were an estimated £250,000 per year by 1750. African rulers largely maintained and dictated the control and supply of captives to the Atlantic slave trade. The impact of the trade was to increase individual fortunes in the short run. But through competition with each others, rulers could have their powers reduced or eliminated as well as strengthened. In the long run, the scale of the Atlantic trade caused instability and collapse in many African states. Middlemen, traders and merchants\nThe kings and warlords needed points of sale, and Europeans needed access to sources of slaves. Some African slave sellers became extremely wealthy from the expansion of the slave trade networks.'];African rulers contributed significantly to the triangular trade by controlling and supplying captives to the Atlantic slave trade. They captured individuals from inland areas and transported them to the coast where they were sold to European traders in exchange for various goods.

The Marshall Plan required a reduction of interstate barriers, a dropping of many regulations, and encouraged an increase in productivity, as well as the adoption of modern business procedures. The Marshall Plan aid was divided among the participant states roughly on a per capita basis. A larger amount was given to the major industrial powers, as the prevailing opinion was that their resuscitation was essential for the general European revival. Somewhat more aid per capita was also directed toward the Allied nations, with less for those that had been part of the Axis or remained neutral. The largest recipient of Marshall Plan money was the United Kingdom (receiving about 26% of the total), but the enormous cost that Britain incurred through the "" Lend-Lease "" scheme was not fully re-paid to the USA until 2006. The next highest contributions went to France (18%) and West Germany (11%). Some eighteen European countries received Plan benefits.

Thanks to his greatly improved steel production, steel was cheaper and more easily available. Because of this, skyscrapers became reality instead of fantasy-springing up in cities all over. Carnegie's advancements in steel fed the national economy as well as the second industrial revolution. He created jobs for many, including immigrants. The growing popularity of skyscrapers meant that more and more were being built, and of course people were needed to build them. The job was very dangerous, and some men died while performing it, but money was money, and many immigrants had very little of that to begin with. Today, evidence of Carnegie's brilliance is everywhere-in the libraries and music halls he funded, the technical institute bearing his name, but most of all in our cities skylines. America would not be where it is today if not for Andrew Carnegie."", 'The book also set the stage for the legislation of the Hepburn Act of 1906, the Mann-Elkins Act, the Clayton Anti-Trust Act, and the creation of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914.

Carnegie was a steel industry tycoon in the late 19th century – and became one of the richest people in America and the world. His net worth is estimated at USD $372 Billion in 2014 dollars, adjusted for inflation. ( 9)\nRockefeller wanted to monopolize the medical field in order to sell pharmaceutical drugs. He knew he could patent the drugs, but he couldn’t patent natural medicine or any source coming from nature. To achieve his goal, he knew he had to eliminate the competition: natural medicine (homeopathy, herbal therapies, naturopathy, etc.). Together with Carnegie, they devised a strategy that would forever change the direction of medical education in the U.S.\nAbraham Flexner (1866-1959) was not a physician or scientist or medical educator. He was a former school teacher, expert on educational practices, had specialized training in psychology, held a bachelor of arts degree, and was founder and operator of a for-profit college-prep school in Louisville, Kentucky.', 'Conclusion\nAndrew Carnegie marked the advent of a new force that would be called “philanthropy” in this and previous centuries. Modern philanthropy owes much to this person. His influence is apparent, for example, in the modern American foundations. Together with some other philanthropic pioneers of his generation, who took his example, he contributed much to this new form of generosity. A lot of the foundations bearing his name still actively help people all over the world. His peculiar vision of a life led to the appearance of thousands of libraries around the world as well as many revolutions in their functioning. During his life, he has contributed more than $350,000,000 to numerous educational causes around the world, and managed to change people’s at', 'During his lifetime, Carnegie created a number of charitable institutions that bore his name. In 1900, he founded the Carnegie Technical Schools, later the Carnegie Institute, and known today as Carnegie Mellon University, one of the world’s leading research universities. In 1904, he created what he called his “pet child,” the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission, which recognizes and rewards individuals who spontaneously risk life and limb to rush to the aid of others. A year later, he launched the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, whose many accomplishments include the Flexner Report (which revolutionized American medical education) and the provision of pensions to college faculty members (which increased the attractiveness of an academic career). Other organizations would bear his name, including the Carnegie Relief Fund (for the benefit of injured steelworkers), the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust (to support his hometown), and the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland (to bolster higher education in his native land). Manhattan’s Music Hall was not supposed to bear its patron’s name, but when European notables declined to attend a “music hall,” its benefactor relented and in 1893 the facility was renamed Carnegie Hall. Not all of Carnegie’s efforts turned out successfully. For much of the final third of his life, he devoted his fortune (and personal influence) to encourage the peaceful resolution of international conflicts. For precisely that purpose, he created and closely attended to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs. The outbreak of World War I dashed his hopes of world peace and precipitated his retreat from the public stage.', 'The Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, founded in 1896, was designed to improve and promote cultural and educational institutions of Pittsburgh; The Carnegie Institute, which was opened in 1901 in Washington, DC with the support of the US President Theodore Roosevelt, was conceived as a research center to help university education with its research development. In ten years, Carnegie granted a total of 22 million dollars to this Institute. It is possible to assume, that this money was used to discover the expansion of the universe, to prove the essence of DNA as the genetic material, to develop radar, and to find the ruins of the Mayan civilization; The Carnegie Hero Fund (Pittsburgh), founded in 1904, was intended to promote people who had dedicated their activities to peacemaking, who had risked their lives in heroic circumstances, and had saved the lives of others to recognize their deeds by awarding such people medals, material grants, pensions, money for education, etc. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (New York), which was founded in 1905. The Foundation was initially intended to pay pensions to the teachers (Andrew Carnegie was indignant with the fact that most teachers are paid like clerks in his office), but then it was engaged in the creation of educational standards and uniform national texts. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, founded in 1910, was intended (in a broad sense) to establish mutual understanding between the peoples and dissemination of information (mostly in the form of publications) in order to preserve peace. It received a total of $10 million during its creation, but now it is considered to be the oldest non-governmental organization specializing in issues of war and peace. This fund finances international conferences, publications and scientific investigations of young researchers (for example, one of them was Sigmund Freud).']";Andrew Carnegie significantly impacted modern medicine primarily through his philanthropic support for medical education.

Breitbart.com reports: While no one in the media want to talk about it, CNN’s relentless fake news sprees have not only created a massive credibility problem for the hate network, the far-left cable channel’s ratings crisis is even more severe. Due to the network’s critical reporting on the actions of his administration, President Trump has frequently singled out CNN as one of the worst offenders in what he calls the “fake news media.” The practice has also been taken up by web sites such as Your News Wire and Breitbart, both of which have rushed to attribute CNN’s falling ratings to a “massive credibility problem.” However, a recent poll conducted by Monmouth University found that despite a general consensus that even traditional media outlets engage in some so-called “fake news” reporting, roughly half of Americans say they still trust CNN more than Trump as an information source. ( Adweek ‘s reporting did not speculate on the putative causes of CNN’s ratings blip.) In any case, despite its year-over-year decline, CNN remained the seventh most-watched cable network in (terms of total-day viewership) for the week in question, and the eleventh most-watched in prime time. While that may be temporarily troublesome in terms of getting top dollar for advertising, it’s wishful thinking on the part of CNN’s detractors to interpret it as spelling doom for the network, which has weathered innumerable ups and downs in the television rating wars over the 38 years of its existence. Despite being down in prime time viewership during the first three months of 2018, for example, CNN posted its second-best first-quarter ratings in 10 years.']";CNN has faced several issues that have contributed to a loss of credibility as a news source. Firstly, the network has been involved in the publication of false stories, such as the alleged meetings between POTUS associates and Russian financiers, which led to the resignation of three journalists including a Pulitzer finalist when the stories were proven false. Additionally, a CNN producer was recorded stating that the Russia collusion narrative was pushed primarily for ratings, despite lacking substantial evidence, which further tainted the network's reputation for reliability in news reporting. These combined factors, along with accusations of biased reporting and disseminating misleading statistics on issues like school shootings, have significantly undermined public trust in CNN.;['Chris Cuomo scandal', 'Questionable reporting practices', 'Bias accusations', 'Negative Trump coverage', 'Lack of objectivity', 'Controversial analysts', 'Misleading headlines', 'Failed fact checks', 'Retracted stories', 'Increased opinion programming', 'Appealing to audience biases', 'Lowered trust among Republicans', 'Inconsistent reporting', 'Ratings decline', 'Loss of viewers post-Trump', 'Focus on profits', 'Sarah Isgur Flores hiring', 'Lack of transparency'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital'];['not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.6

Constantine, therefore, moved the capital of the empire to a new city – Constantinople. This was a new city that was built on the old city of Byzantium.

Rome’s many roads made it easy prey for the Franks, the Vandals, the Lombards and the Goths, the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths to invade the Italian countryside. Those Germanic tribes moved into the empire because they were pushed West by the Huns, a violent band of nomadic warriors. Emperor Constantine realized the city of Rome was vulnerable to attack. In 324CE, he began construction of a “New Rome"" in Byzantium, a Greek city almost 1500 miles to the east. The emperor renamed the city “Constantinople,"" which means “city of Constantine."" advertisement\nRoman civilization survived for centuries in Constantine’s eastern empire, while Rome and the empire’s western provinces fell to the Germanic invaders. Historians refer to the Eastern Roman Empire as the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantine Empire included parts of modern Greece, Serbia and Turkey. The Byzantine Empire lasted until 1453, when it fell to Turkish warriors.', 'Listen Now\nEast weakening west\nConstantinople was the capital now. It was an increasingly well-developed and well-fortified city, mirroring the rest of the Eastern empire. The strength of the East prompted any aggressors to turn their attention towards the West.

He raised taxes in the West to bring them up to the level of those in the East to seem fair.

Explain the media’s role as a linkage institution. Traditional news media, new communication technologies, and advances in social media have profoundly influenced how citizens routinely acquire political information, including new events, investigative journalism, election coverage, and political commentary. The media’s use of polling results to convey popular levels of trust and confidence in government can impact elections by turning such events into “horse races” based more on popularity and factors other than qualifications and platforms of candidates. Explain how increasingly diverse choices of media and communication outlets influence political institutions and behavior. Political participation is influenced by a variety of media coverage, analysis, and commentary on political events. The rapidly increasing demand for media and political communications outlets from an ideologically diverse audience have led debates over media bias and the impact of media ownership and partisan news sites. The nature of democratic debate and the level of political knowledge among citizens is impacted by: Increased media choices\nIdeologically oriented programming\nConsumer-driven media outlets and emerging technologies that reinforce existing beliefs\nUncertainty over the credibility of news sources and information', 'Key takeaways\nImpact on political agenda and participation: — In its “gatekeeper” role, the media has a significant influence on the issues that citizens know and care about, which may drive subsequent government action to address those issues through policy. Changes in how the media reports news, and how the public consumes it, have also had an impact on politics. For example, the use of investigative journalism to discredit candidates has contributed to decreased public trust in politicians. The rising prominence of the internet and social media as news sources have reduced the extent to which news is curated by professionals, a phenomenon commonly credited with causing a corresponding rise in “fake news.” “Horse race” journalism — The ups and downs of political contests between candidates are often more dramatic than policy debates, so the media focuses more on the former than the latter. Critics argue that this devalues politics by reducing the importance of policy. Others contend that raising awareness of the contest between candidates can increase transparency and political participation, particularly during parties’ candidate selection process.

Those choices alone can have a huge effect on voter perceptions. “As hard as it is to believe, the biggest thing that drives elections is simple name recognition,” said Regina Lawrence, executive director of the UO SOJC’s Agora Journalism Center and George S. Turnbull Portland Center. “ Research has shown that some candidates can be literally left invisible because they can’t win enough interest from the media.” Lawrence, a nationally recognized expert on political communication and the co-author of “Hillary Clinton’s Race for the White House: Gender Politics and the Media on the Campaign Trail” and “When the Press Fails: Political Power and the News Media from Iraq to Katrina,” said this effect was most noticeable during the Republican primaries, when Trump generated an outsized proportion of the media coverage. “He was able to get the equivalent of massive advertising buys without having to spend much money,” Lawrence said. For the media, this disproportionate coverage was driven more by economics than political bias. In a competitive 24/7 news cycle, news organizations publish stories that will drive traffic.', 'when they are the only real source we as the people have to depend on to receive that type of info it must be taken serious. I feel the media has a set agenda when addressing political issues, its cut and dry either their trying to get the audience to embrace their point of\nview or discredit someone else’s. But when it’s all said and done, the news networks are ran by the same politicians we see on the news, and it’s a known fact that if an individual see’s and hears something enough they start to believe it, and that is what the news does, they continue to press these images in to societies head until we have no choice but to believe it.

Firstly, the rapid dissemination of news through electronic media means that political events and narratives can reach the public almost instantaneously, increasing the speed of political communication and potentially the responsiveness of political actors to unfolding events. Secondly, electronic journalism has broadened the scope of political reporting through investigative journalism and diverse media outlets, which can shape public opinion and influence political agendas by increasing scrutiny and accountability of political figures.

There was a focus on more environmental explanations of homicide in the early to mid 20th century, largely in reaction to the previous focus on intra-individual explanations of homicidal behavior. Environmental Theories of Homicide\nEnvironmental theories can be described generally as focusing on sources or causes of homicidal behavior outside the individual. Examples of such theories include socialization theories, symbolic interactionism, social structural theories, control theory, and social ecology theory. Socialization theories of homicide and aggression have historically been among the most popular and influential accounts of the motivations for homicide. The sex difference in the commission of violent crimes— including homicide—was one of the first and most obvious observations demanding explanation. Men are more often than women both the offenders and the victims of homicides. Socialization theories argue that men, more than women, have been socialized to view aggression as a permissible means to achieve certain ends. This differential socialization for aggressive behavior in men and women, it is argued, can explain the greater homicide rates among men. While this theory has been well received within psychology, there is growing evidence that an exclusive reliance on this theoretical position to explain homicide patterns leads to incomplete conclusions.', 'Socialization theories push back one step many of the most intriguing questions psychologists working to understand homicide have tried to answer. Why are men and women differentially socialized to behave aggressively? Why are boys and girls differentially receptive to certain aspects of environmental input? Socialization theories cannot provide answers to such questions. Despite the limitations of environmental theories, insight has been gained from the research conducted by social scientists focusing on social and cultural influences. One notable finding reflecting the cultural and demographic variables within cultures has resulted from research on homicide rates across the United States. Social scientists have identified key sociocultural beliefs and attitudes that vary by region and have analyzed homicide rates as a function of these different beliefs and attitudes. The Southern states in the United States adhere more strongly to a “culture of honor” than other regions. In the Southern states, men act more aggressively than men in the Northern states to protect their honor and their reputation. This difference is arguably generated by exposure to a culture in which honor and reputation are very important in protecting resources.', 'Socio-occupational effects include problems in school and at work. Homicide may also lead families to incur expenses they can ill afford, such as funeral costs and lawyer fees. If the victim was a breadwinner, families may no longer be able to cope financially. Homicide can generate a sense of insecurity in society, and when high rates occur in countries with weak, inefficient and corrupt criminal justice systems, can contribute to undermining social and economic development. Studies of homicide risk factors\nHomicide is caused by mix of factors at the individual, relationship, community and societal levels. Demographic structure is a well-established risk factor for homicide. Societies where young people – particularly young males – make up a greater share of the population tend to have higher homicide rates. Transitions in political regimes may also be associated with increased homicide. The fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, apartheid in South Africa, and dictatorship in Brazil all saw rapid increases in homicide rates. Homicide rates may increase in the absence of good governance and effective rule of law.', 'The sex difference in the commission of violent crimes— including homicide—was one of the first and most obvious observations demanding explanation.

While this theory has been well received within psychology, there is growing evidence that an exclusive reliance on this theoretical position to explain homicide patterns leads to incomplete conclusions. Socialization theories push back one step many of the most intriguing questions psychologists working to understand homicide have tried to answer. Why are men and women differentially socialized to behave aggressively? Why are boys and girls differentially receptive to certain aspects of environmental input? Socialization theories cannot provide answers to such questions. Despite the limitations of environmental theories, insight has been gained from the research conducted by social scientists focusing on social and cultural influences.', 'Demographic structure is a well-established risk factor for homicide. Societies where young people – particularly young males – make up a greater share of the population tend to have higher homicide rates. Transitions in political regimes may also be associated with increased homicide. The fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, apartheid in South Africa, and dictatorship in Brazil all saw rapid increases in homicide rates. Homicide rates may increase in the absence of good governance and effective rule of law. Homicide rates tend to be lower where states have legitimacy in the eyes of citizens, can deliver key political goods such as justice based on the rule of law, and have low levels of corruption. Poverty, economic inequality, ethnic fractionalization, and the availability of guns and alcohol are also risk factors for homicide.

This focus is contrasted with environmental theories, which consider external factors influencing such behaviors. The passage outlines how this shift in focus from solely individualistic explanations to include environmental factors broader brought insights into varying homicide rates, particularly revealing how sociocultural and demographic factors, like the ""culture of honor"" in Southern states or demographic structures with large young male populations, can impact regional homicide rates.

ERIC GAY/AFP/Getty Images\nA mass shooting is defined by the FBI as a shooting that kills four or more people, excluding the shooter or shooters. Using this definition, the history of mass school shootings in the United States dates back to even before the U.S. officially became a country. In 1764, three men entered a schoolhouse near present-day Greencastle, Pennsylvania, and reportedly killed 10 people. It wasn't until 1966, though, that the next mass shooting — or, at least, the next incident that would readily be recognized as a mass shooting today — occurred. In August of that year, a 25-year-old man named Charles Whitman went on a 96-minute shooting spree from an observation deck at the University of Texas-Austin, killing 17 people and wounding 31 others in an attack that sounds eerily reminiscent of the stories that you're all too used to hearing today. Whitman also murdered his wife and mother earlier that day before continuing on to the university — not unlike Adam Lanza, who shot and killed his mother before opening fire at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012. TIM SLOAN/AFP/Getty Images\nAs tragic as it was, Columbine wasn't the deadliest mass shooting at a U.S. school, either. In 2007, a massacre at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, left 33 people, including the shooter, dead and 17 wounded. Ultimately, it seems that virtually no conversation about gun violence in the U.S. would be complete without mentioning the mass casualties that have occurred at the hands of mentally troubled and otherwise disturbed young people on school grounds."", ""Recent school shootings (and other mass shootings) have contributed to an rise public concern over gun violence and socialization of children and young adults.

The worst of them took the lives of 5 people in Charles Town in West Virginia in 1898.

The first known mass shooting in the U.S. where students were shot, was on April 9, 1891, when 70 year old, James Foster fired a shotgun at a group of students in the playground of St. Mary's Parochial School, Newburgh, New York, causing minor injuries to several of the students. The majority of attacks during this time period by students on other students or teacher, usually involved stabbing with knives, or hitting with stones. 1900-1930s\nThere are very seldom reports of mass or multiple school shootings during the first three decades of the 20th Century, with the three most violent attacks on schools involving either arson or explosions. February 26, 1902 Camargo, Illinois teacher Fletcher R. Barnett shot and killed another teacher, Eva C. Wiseman, in front of her class at a school near Camargo, Illinois. After shooting at a pupil who came to help Miss Wiseman and wounding himself in a failed suicide attempt he waited in the classroom until a group of farmers came to lynch him. He then ran out of the school building, grabbed a shotgun from one of the farmers and shot himself, before running away and leaping into a well where he finally drowned. The incident was likely sparked by Wiseman's refusal to marry Barnett. February 24, 1903 Inman, South Carolina Edward Foster, a 17-year-old student at Inman High school, was shot and fatally wounded by his teacher Reuben Pitts after he had jerked a rod from Pitts' hands to resist punishment.

The opportunities this presented for artists was vast and unfettered."", 'A Government-backed program\nIn 1920, the new government decided to follow in Dr. Atl\'s footsteps, and commissioned a large number of public works of art which would promote and support the values fundamental to the revolution and to help establish a new identity for Mexico. This new identity was based on Mexico\'s rich historical traditions as well as a sense of moving forward into the modern age. Importantly, most Mexicans at the time were illiterate, and promoting the new government\'s message could not be accomplished through traditional media such as pamphlets and newspapers. Instead, the government communicated their cause through large-scale murals in public places which could be seen by many. The murals\' aesthetic appeal would also help Mexicans adapt to the new regime by affecting an overall sense of pride and cultural beauty within the communities as a whole. The murals were usually painted with themes glorifying the Mexican Revolution, recalling Mexico\'s early pre-Hispanic heritage and promoting the ideals of the new government. In order to create these murals, the government employed some of the best Mexican artists of the day. Some of these artists, including Diego Rivera, had spent time in Europe before the revolution, and were well acquainted with the European realism movement overseas in which artists used painting to demonstrate the dire conditions of the downtrodden working classes. This was a key influence on the revelatory style of the Mexican Muralist movement. Los Tres Grandes\nDavid Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco, and Diego Rivera became the leaders of the muralist movement in Mexico and became known internationally as ""los tres grandes"" or ""the big three.""', 'It was a new music, waiting for the composer with genius enough to give it communicable form."" 11 of 11\nSummary of Mexican Muralism\nOriginally spawned by the need to promote pride and nationalism in a country rebuilding after revolution, the Mexican Muralist movement brought mural painting back from its staid retirement in the history of ancient peoples as a respected artistic form with a strong social potential. With it, a rich visual language emerged in public spaces as a means to make art accessible to all. It provided an opportunity to educate and inform the common man with its messages of cultural identity, politics, oppression, resistance, progress, and other important issues of the time. It was a fiercely independent movement; many of its early artists rejecting external influences and used this new, vast, and freeing medium to achieve personal expression.

Oftentimes these messages promoted pride in cultural identity, rich historical traditions, or political propaganda. The potential in murals bypassed more traditional forms of advertising and pamphlet printing.', 'Concepts, Styles, and Trends\nRevolution\nBecause the Mexican Muralist movement was spurred by the Mexican Revolution and succeeding civil war, one of its key aims was to shake up art in the same way that the revolution had shaken up Mexican society. Mural painting was ideal for inspiring revolutionary fervor in a mostly-illiterate population, due to its narrative content and availability in public places, eschewing the traditionally elitist environment of the museum. As well as rejecting the traditional places for showing art, the movement hoped to reject all the conventional trappings of artistic production. To this end, they chose to paint directly onto walls with painting materials inspired by traditional native Mexican wall paintings. The resulting murals were shaped according to the architecture of the designated space, rejecting the usual rectangular shape of the canvas that had come to dominate Western art. Similarly, the production of murals under government commissions meant that the art produced was not for sale, undermining the traditionally dominant art market. Socialism\nIn the initial post-revolution years of the Mexican Muralist movement, artists were generally given free reign to choose their subjects and express them in whichever way they preferred. Many of the artists involved were ardent socialists or communists, believing in the power of the working classes and in the equal distribution of wealth. Some artists, such as David Alfaro Siqueiros, applied their socialist approach to their artistic process, dividing up tasks and rewarding his assistants equally. Others, such as Orozco, subtly incorporated socialist imagery into their murals, such as the hammer and sickle.']";The Mexican murals significantly influenced the social structure by serving as a tool for education and propaganda, particularly for an illiterate population, thereby enhancing community inclusion and cohesion. As public art, these murals bypassed traditional elitist channels like galleries and museums and made art accessible to all people, democratizing the way art influenced society. This openness allowed the murals not only to reflect the social and political climates, such as the impact of the Mexican Revolution, but also to actively participate in shaping a new national identity rooted in pride, cultural heritage, and contemporary social values, thus embedding deeper social unity and awareness among the Mexican populace.;['Mexican murals promoted social and political change.', 'They challenged social inequalities and injustices.', 'Murals conveyed revolutionary ideals and history.', 'They served as powerful social commentary.', 'Murals empowered marginalized communities.', 'They depicted everyday life and ancient history.', 'Art became a tool for social and political activism.', 'Murals addressed labor exploitation and class struggle.', 'They fostered national unity and identity.', 'Murals addressed issues of citizenship and nationality.', 'They reflected social change (rural to industrial).', 'Murals sparked public discourse and debate.', 'They provided a visual record of Mexican history.', 'Murals celebrated Mexican heritage and indigenous culture.', 'They influenced later art movements (graffiti, Chicano).', 'Government-sponsored, yet artistically independent.', 'Murals fostered dialogue about social issues.', 'They depicted the lives of the poor and peasants.'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay'];['support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support'];0.6363636363636364

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the heavily rural state was hostile to business and railroads, with the Republicans dominant in the small towns, and the Democrats on the farms. Numerous left-wing groups and third-parties emerged, such as the Anti-Monopolist party in the 1870s, the Populists in the 1890s, the Non-Partisan League in the 1910s, and the Farmer–Labor party in the 1930s. Isolationism was strong, Adkins argues, because of the fear that Eastern bankers and industrialists forced the United States into World War I to enlarge their profits. Business fought unions, and the unions fought back, and with the governor on their side unions won some violent battles in the 1930s. In recent decades, however, the liberal coalition has weakened. Labor unions are a shadow of their old strength.

From Nonpartisan to Polarized\nTo understand how Minnesota earned its blue reputation in the first place, we should examine an earlier time, when “blue” and “red” had different meanings than they do today. By the turn of the 20th century, the U.S. had entered a period of progressivism. Along with trust-busting legislation and muckraking journalism, Minnesota’s Scandinavian-rooted Christian culture had sown distrust in big corporations and political parties. In a controversial 1913 decision, Minnesota actually took parties off the ballot for the state legislature. Voting came down to candidates’ personal merits and causes over affiliation. In the mid-’40s, after President Franklin Roosevelt revived progressivism with his New Deal and turned Minnesota blue for the first time since statehood, local Democrats merged with the state’s Farmer-Labor Party to become the Democratic-Farmer-Laborers (DFL). The party pulled in Minnesota’s farmers and union workers. When partisan state legislature contests resumed in the ’70s, the DFL took over for the next two decades.']";The liberal political landscape of Minnesota developed over time due to several historical tendencies and movements. Historically, Minnesota harbored a distrust towards big corporations and political parties, rooted in its Scandinavian-Christian culture, which led to progressivism around the turn of the 20th century. Influential movements such as the Populists, Non-Partisan League, and the Farmer–Labor party advocated for the interests of farmers and labor unions, battling against business interests. Over time, these movements contributed to the establishment of the Democratic-Farmer-Laborers (DFL) party, which aligned Minnesota with liberal policies by merging the interests of farmers and union workers, shaping the state's modern liberal identity.;['Progressive political tradition', 'Strong liberal voting base', 'High voter turnout', 'Twin Cities growth', 'Demographic shifts', 'Immigration and refugee resettlement', 'Scandinavian heritage', 'Union strength', 'New Deal influence', 'Hubert Humphrey’s legacy', 'Progressive policies', 'Democratic control of state legislature and governorship', 'Farmer-Labor Party success', 'DFL party merger', 'Increased Republican appeal in rural areas', 'Narrowing Democratic lead in recent elections', 'Seven consecutive Democratic presidential wins (until recently)'];['vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.45454545454545453

Moving beyond celebrations of culture and identity found in gatherings at powwows, a group of Bay Area urban Indians activist students led by Richard Oakes occupied Alcatraz, beginning on November 9, 1969 and lasted for 19 months. With the founding of the American Indian Movement in 1968 and the occupation of Alcatraz beginning in 1969, Native Americans living in urban areas and on reservations gained new recognition in Washington DC and California. Tribal membership roles, once used by the federal government to determine who received government annuities (supplies to live on), were turned back to tribes who, partially because of casino monies, adopted blood quantum as a way of keeping out or weeding out tribal members with questionable ancestry. There was no longer the issue between the federal government and Native Americans of is or is not a Native American. That issue now resides within the tribal cultures. Many California tribes, seeking formal recognition from the federal government and thus sovereign status, are also trying to not only maintain traditions and relearn, or in some instances, reinvent “lost” languages. They are also being challenged to preserve their own identity under pressure from a pan-Indian urban culture whose numbers are overwhelming. In 1900, Native Americans in California numbered in the low 16,000s. Today the number is around 200,000.', 'The government believed the time was right to initiate a new policy. Advocates for policy change pointed out the fact that between 1917 and 1945, nearly 100,000 Native Americans had left reservations to find new ways to support their families. From the Native American perspective however, this relocation policy was yet another attempt to remove Native Americans from their reservations and small allotments in order for the government to exploit the land for development and resources extraction. Ultimately, for Native Americans, removal and assimilation were both policies designed to give the federal government the power to decide who was or was not a member of a Native American tribe. According the 1953 legislation, tribes would relinquish their sovereignty by leaving the reservations and assuming rights and responsibilities as American citizens. Of the 35,000 participants, about 30% returned to their reservations. Many who remained in the program lived in urban poverty, poor health, with substance abuse, emotional suffering, and a terrible loss of tribal connection and cultural identity. Their common heritage of small community and rural culture values, and dependence of the BIA did not prepare them for the strains of urban living. Nonetheless, over time, Indian communities in relocation centers around the nation became multi-tribal, made up of relocated families and their descendents. So many came to California because they believed that it was the land of new beginnings.', ""Urbanization brought an influx of rich haole from the American continent who, unlike tourists, wanted to live in Hawai'i. Evictions of Hawaiians lead to increasing protest, especially in communities scheduled for residential and commercial development. An early and typical example here was the Kalama Valley eviction on O'ahu island in 1970. Rural Hawaiians living by month-to-month leases on lands controlled by one of the largest private trusts in Hawai'i, the Bishop Estate, were given one month's notice to leave their homes and farms of more than twenty years. The residents' resistance called forth an outpouring of support throughout the archipelago. Although the residents failed to stop their eviction and the transformation of their pig and vegetable farms into upper-income developments, the resistance began to spread to every island. By 1976, Hawaiians were landing on Kaho'olawe Island to protest its use as a military bombing range since the second World War. Kaho'olawe is home to many navigational and other ancient Native sites.

Although this was a clear victory for the Native people, the military has not lost major ground in Hawai'i."", 'Los Angeles and the Bay Area Indian communities both grew way beyond the California indigenous populations. Many intertribal marriages produced descendants identified as urban Indians by non Native Americans rather than by specific tribal identification. They established Native American cultural centers, held powwows, and provided what community support they could. Tribal identity, although not lost, was certainly weakened and no longer the overriding recognition point for non Native Americans. For Native Americans living in California cities, however, identity continued to be a central issue in their lives. Gatherings of different tribe members in cities like San Francisco, Oakland, and Los Angeles promoted a pan-Indian consciousness that produced a new activism. Moving beyond celebrations of culture and identity found in gatherings at powwows, a group of Bay Area urban Indians activist students led by Richard Oakes occupied Alcatraz, beginning on November 9, 1969 and lasted for 19 months. With the founding of the American Indian Movement in 1968 and the occupation of Alcatraz beginning in 1969, Native Americans living in urban areas and on reservations gained new recognition in Washington DC and California. Tribal membership roles, once used by the federal government to determine who received government annuities (supplies to live on), were turned back to tribes who, partially because of casino monies, adopted blood quantum as a way of keeping out or weeding out tribal members with questionable ancestry. There was no longer the issue between the federal government and Native Americans of is or is not a Native American.', 'After failing to receive any pay for three months, internees protested and the turbulence resulted in the riots on December 6.

Months of internal tension and gang activity had raged between members of the Japanese American Citizens League  (JACL) and many of the first-generation Japanese. Although the JACL leaders acted as representatives to the administration, the elders did not share their views and had little respect for them. Meetings turned into shouting sessions with beatings and death threats against the pro-administration group. On the night of December 5, six masked men beat JACL leader Fred Tayama while he was in his bed. The leader of the Kitchen Workers Union, Harry Ueno, was arrested for the beating and jailed in the nearby town of Independence despite a lack of conclusive evidence. The next day about 2,000 internees gathered in support of Ueno, and a ""committee of five"" was selected to negotiate his release. Center Director Ralph Merritt attempted to talk with the agitated crowd and subsequently agreed to bring Ueno back to the relocation center jail to avoid further violence or bloodshed.']";The passage provided does not contain specific details on how the residents of Old Riaño protested their relocation.

On top of that, noble landowners increased the taxes that peasants had to pay. Because of their suffering, Luther\'s ideas stirred the peasants to revolt.

One leader said the peasants would no longer work for the nobles, ""unless it should be shown us from the Gospel that we are serfs.""', ""Reluctant Inspiration\nThe relationship between the Protestant Reformation and the Peasants' War has long been a subject of debate. A traditional understanding in this matter is that the Peasants' Revolt stemmed from Martin Luther's doctrine of spiritual freedom and the application of his ideas as religious justification for social and political upheaval. It is true that Luther offered useful tools to the peasants: his focus on Sola Scriptura put emphasis upon the priesthood of all believers. This strengthened the idea of 'Godly law', that social constructs counter to Godly law could not command the allegiance of the people and justified rebellion. Perhaps also influential to the revolt was the example of Luther, as his work was a rebellion against the two most significant authorities of the era when he opposed both the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor. It is likely that Luther's views simply coincided with the desires of the peasants, and were used for that reason. Other religious personalities such as Huldrych Zwingli and Thomas Müntzer also influenced the peasants. Zwingli taught from 1523 onwards that in order for the gospel to be successful, secular laws needed to be transformed according to the law of God, something which corresponded neatly with what the peasants wanted. Müntzer, who would lead a peasants' army until its defeat at Frankenhausen (15 May 1525) by Imperial troops, was able to encourage them by citing scriptural passages that seemed to support rebellion against lawful authority:"", 'A major rebellion broke out in Lower Swabia in 1524, and spread to the neighboring regions during spring of 1525 supported by about 300 000 rebels [4]. What was new about this rebellion was that the peasants used a new mighty ideological weapon – Protestantism. Throughout the Middle Ages illiterate peasants poorly understood religious teaching including the text of the Bible. The holy texts were all written in Latin and inaccessible for the majority of population. Luther’s translation of the Bible into German combined with invention of book printing by Gutenberg allowed to bring the text of the Bible to every village. Upon reading it, the peasants could now ask a reasonable question: “ When Adam dug and Eve spun, where was then the nobleman?” [ 5] Local clergy often supported the rebels, including such famous supporters as Thomas Müntzer. Yet the peasants expected Luther himself to choose their side. Luther’s Attitude\nAt the early stages of the rebellion Luther indeed sympathized peasants grieves, although refusing to join the rebels openly.', ""Perhaps also influential to the revolt was the example of Luther, as his work was a rebellion against the two most significant authorities of the era when he opposed both the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor.

To a peasantry oppressed in so many ways on so many levels, the leadership of men like Müntzer and the inspiration of scripture that appeared to justify violence would make rebellion seem very tempting indeed. Furthermore, Luther's attacks on the Roman Catholic church can be said to have inspired various groups to raise arms in revolution. Peasants related to Luther's appeals against the clergy and ideas about Christian freedom, and wished to ‘wreak vengeance upon all their oppressors’. More powerful members of society, including burghers and lesser nobility, sought to break the power of the clergy, escape the demands of Rome, and gain financially from the confiscation of church property.""]";"Peasants utilized Martin Luther's ideas during their revolts primarily by drawing parallels between Luther’s theological rebellion against corrupt religious authority and their own socio-economic grievances against oppressive nobility. Luther's advocacy for spiritual freedom and scriptural justification provided a moral framework for peasants to challenge the feudal structures imposed upon them, echoing his challenge to the existing ecclesiastical hierarchy.

It does not challenge the logic that the decline in war affected the war–state connection. 2 However, it does not see this change as evidence of atrophy. Instead, it demonstrates how the complexity of war after 1945 led to a deep but more subtle interaction, which had a profound effect on war, the state and society in the western world. While I do not challenge the premise that a range of factors played a role in shaping the connection between war and the state, the precise interaction and relative importance of these forces have altered over time, and this has caused the demands of war on the state to shift in significant ways. In the period under scrutiny in this article, I argue that the role of technology in war increased dramatically because of the nuclear revolution. In this setting, technological development reduced the opportunities for war, but the arms race it generated also brought into being new technologies, and these facilitated new forms of conflict. These developments affected our understanding of war's character and its interaction with the state.

Among them: Changes in Science and Technology: At the end of the war, \r\ntheoretical science and technology, considered more practical were joined \r\ntogether. University scientists worked on top secret projects during the war, \r\nincluding the development of radar to detect enemy aircraft. Radar was \r\nparticularly valuable to the British in defeating the Germans in the Battle of \r\nBritain. Other wartime technological developments included the development of \r\njet aircraft and electronic computers which could calculate the mathematical \r\nrelationship between a fast moving plane and anti-aircraft shells, so that \r\ngunners on the ground had a greater probability of shooting down the plane. By far the greatest technological scientific development was the development \r\nof the Atomic Bomb. Its development was spurred by a letter from Albert Einstein \r\nto President Franklin Roosevelt, in August, 1939, in which he stated that ""it \r\nmay be possible to set up a nuclear reaction in a large mass of uranium… [And \r\nconstruct] extremely powerful bombs of a new type.

Postwar reconstruction\nTwo factors led to the rapid rise of modern architecture during this period. First, the industrial demands during World War II resulted in the shortage of building materials like steel, which lead to the adoption of new materials like aluminum. Second, there was unparalleled destruction during the war, and buildings needed to be reconstructed. The use of prefabricated buildings was largely expanded during the war and postwar period for government and military buildings. Radical experimental houses like the Lustron house and Dymaxion House were also witnessed between 1947-1950. The government financed enormous construction projects during the postwar period to cover for the housing shortages. These projects were carried out in cities and suburbs where land was available. For example, the Le Havre city center was one of the biggest reconstruction projects carried out after being destroyed by the Germans. A pioneer in the use of prefabricated materials and reinforced concrete, Architect Auguste Perret, built an entirely new center in the city.', 'Conflict, Security, and Defence All Journals search input Search\nAdvanced Search\nSearch Menu\nAbstract\nWar made the state, and the state made war, but does this statement hold true today? Will it apply in the future? The consensus is that the absence of major war within the western world, post 1945, did cause the war–state relationship to change, but each became significantly less important to the other. This article argues that the relationship was closer and deeper than has been assumed. It proposes that the peculiar strategic conditions created by the nuclear age caused states to wage a ritualistic style of war, in which demonstration rather than the physical application of violence became increasingly important. Within this setting, the state drove the process of technological innovation in defence to its limits in an effort to demonstrate its military superiority. This massive peacetime investment in defence technology exerted a huge impact on the character of war, which led to new strategic forms. However, most importantly, the diffusion of military technology also affected the wider economy and society, leading to a form of internal power transition within states. The author speculates on how these elemental forces will play out in the future, what will happen to war and the state, and whether we will reach a point where war leads to the unmaking of the state.

After the war, there was destruction and material shortages which led to innovations like the use of prefabricated buildings and new materials such as aluminum.

The first two camps were armed with nuclear weapons. The rivalry between the two superpowers quickly spread to the rest of the world. The USA encouraged other friendly regions in the world to form their own alliance such as CENTO in the Middle East and SEATO in South East Asia, the aim as suggested by Murphy (2003) was to surround the USSR with a military alliance and had resulted in increased tensions. Furthermore both superpowers possessed nuclear missiles that can reach Moscow and Washington respectively. Thus, the Cold War become global and directly affected international stability (Murphy, 2003). In addition, both superpowers resorted to confrontation and propaganda and this, in turn, was played out in the rest of the world. The Cold War led the division of Europe in general and Germany, in particular, it also as pointed out by Cornwell (2001) made possible the modernization and “reintegration” of the defeated powers of Germany, Italy and Japan (Cornwell, 2003).

It further exacerbated and fuelled other conflicts and wars in the Middle East (Painter, 2001). Another aspect of Cold War that had an impact on international relations was protecting sphere of interest by both sides “truly at global level” for example 1956 Hungarian uprising and the subsequent intervention by the Soviet troops, because the soviet did not like the Hungarian’s intention to leave the Warsaw Pact, (Bell, 2001). Similarly, the USA was also maintaining a sphere of interest in other parts of the world, especially in Latin America. During the Cold War, fear of the spread of communism had resulted in US military involvement in Latin America in various ways, for example, the US helped train and provided arms and other assistance to anti-communist in Nicaragua and El-Salvador and by using force to further safeguard its interest in the region.', 'How did the Superpowers affect the economies of the developing nations?

First, as part of their strategic interests, both superpowers engaged in forming alliances and exerting influence in different regions such as Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia, often leading to the installation or support of regimes that aligned with their ideological preferences. Moreover, the rivalry led to direct and indirect military involvement, as seen in the US's engagements in Latin America, where they supported anti-communist groups, impacting the political landscape and contributing to ongoing conflicts and instability in these regions.

Suburban housewives also created clubs which would meet while their children were in school. Not all groups shared equally in the attainment of a home in the suburbs.

I bill, countless families moved from the cities into the suburbs. Government paid programs opened up suburbia to growing numbers of middle class Americans, creating secure jobs for blue-collar workers. Suburbs blossomed into the ideal white neighborhood, where the “American Dream” was to be realized. It was the idea that every young man should marry a young, presentable woman and have darling children. These families would live in the cutout house with a cute kitchen, well-kept yard, and the white picket fence surrounding. The father became the strong figure, working hard to earn for his family; whereas, the mother would stay at home, raise the children, and tend to her husband once he came home. With the G.

Psychological research across families from all ethnic backgrounds suggests that fathers' affection and increased family involvement help promote children's social and emotional development. What has brought this change in roles for men as fathers? Economic Trends\nTwo to three centuries ago, fathers’ roles were primarily to serve as breadwinners and the conveyers of moral values and religious education to their children. However, with the advent of industrialization and urbanization and as factories emerged as major sources of employment, fathers became distanced from the household and their families. Growing rates of abandonment and illegitimacy led to the development of welfare programs to assist widowed or unmarried women in supporting their children. In more recent decades, the changing economic role of women has greatly impacted the role of fathers. Between 1948 and 2001, the percentage of working age women employed or looking for work nearly doubled–from less than 33 percent to more than 60 percent. Their increase in financial power made paternal financial support less necessary for some families. In tandem with the growing autonomy of women, related trends such as declining fertility, increasing rates of divorce and remarriage, and childbirth outside of marriage have resulted in a transition from traditional to multiple undefined roles for many fathers."", 'The father became the strong figure, working hard to earn for his family; whereas, the mother would stay at home, raise the children, and tend to her husband once he came home. With the G. I bill in effect, property taxes were lowered substantially, making suburbia desirable for any white family. On the surface, this idealization may have seemed perfect, but there were many shortcomings that resulted from this illusion. Women were objectified; they essentially had to be the perfect wife and mother. In the 1950’s, women could not pursue their true aspirations, whether they wanted to be CEO of a company, or even start their own business. It was absurd for a woman to become the breadwinner of the family, for this only added to the illusion of the American Dream. Women did not have the opportunity to achieve their own individual desires due to restrictions imposed on their “status” in society. In Betty Friedan’s excerpt from, American Identities, she illuminates how women suffered in the 1950’s, by stating, “Each suburban wife struggled with it alone…they learned that truly feminine women do not want careers, higher education, political rights…. ” (', ""As men left home to work in new industrial jobs, the majority of childrearing was left to their wives. The rise of democratic individualism made the concept of a patriarchal father seem outdated. The Quakers put an end to the traditional belief in children's innate depravity, saying that their inherently good natures thrived not on stern fathering but on gentle, nurturant mothering. As the culture absorbed the many changes brought by an industrial, democratic world, courts began awarding child custody to mothers in the mid-19th century (97). While the position of men became more tenuous within the home, society still celebrated their roles as providers and protectors. However, the coming of the Great Depression showed the weakness of men in the provider role as well. Popenoe considers World War II to have had an ambiguous impact on the status of fatherhood, for while it stressed the vital importance of the protector role, it also showed that millions of women and children were able to get along just fine while fathers were away for months or years at a time. The 1950s saw a flowering of familism in America, perhaps inspired by the wish to get back to a simple domestic life after the trauma of war. The modern nuclear family reached its zenith, with men going to work each day and women staying home to keep the house and care for the children. However, as quickly as it appeared, the 1950s family vanished in the 1960s.""]";The role of fathers underwent significant changes with suburbanization, particularly influenced by post-war societal shifts. Originally, fathers were viewed as primary breadwinners and moral teachers for their children. Yet, the suburban era saw an evolution towards a more detached paternal role as fathers commuted long distances to work, spending considerable time away from home. This transition relegated fathers to be more of financial providers while daily family interaction and child-rearing responsibilities were primarily managed by mothers. This shift reflects broader economic and social transformations, including the rise in women's employment and changing family structures, which diluted the traditional paternal role in hands-on parenting and domestic involvement.;['Post-war suburban ideal: father as breadwinner, emotionally distant.', 'Shifting gender roles: fathers increasingly active caregivers.', 'Fatherhood redefined: emotional support crucial, beyond finance.', 'Economic changes: dual-income families, shared roles.', 'Increased female employment: challenged traditional father image.', 'Modern fathers: diverse roles, increased childcare involvement.', 'Suburbanization: impacted family structures, commuting.', 'GI Bill fueled suburban growth: impacted family dynamics.', 'Suburban life: more group activities, less father-child time.', 'Baby boom: increased family size, strained traditional roles.'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support'];0.5

Hamilton's push for a strong federal role in economic affairs, including the establishment of a national bank and high protective tariffs, influenced the direction of economic policy, particularly in bolstering industrial growth and managing the national debt. Jefferson's advocacy for minimal government intrusion shaped later policies favoring a laissez-faire approach, which led to a volatile yet expanding economy characterized by periods of booms and busts as the country became increasingly industrialized by the end of the century. Despite this, conflicts over the role of a national bank and fluctuating levels of governmental oversight in banking persisted, contributing to the economic landscape's complexity in 19th-century America.;['Washington supported Hamilton’s financial programs', 'First Bank of the US established under Washington', 'Hamilton’s financial plan shaped early US economy', 'National bank promoted single currency, easier trade', 'Protective tariffs implemented to protect American industry', 'Internal improvements (roads, canals) facilitated commerce', 'Government encouraged land sales, internal improvements', 'Washington used military to enforce tax laws', 'Whiskey Rebellion tested federal authority', 'Washington’s economic actions caused political divisions', 'Washington prioritized national security over entangling alliances', 'Washington’s neutrality impacted US trade', 'Expansion westward fueled economic growth'];['vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.25

But substitute the word manipulate for motivate in the previous sentence, and what at first sounded reasonable now seems disturbing. None of us wants to manipulate students. Every day, however, we practice the art of persuasion, convincing students that our subjects are worth their time and energy. This persuasion is tricky because of the dance between middle schoolers' lingering childlike curiosity and their mounting distractions: peers, sex, risk taking, pop stars, and keeping track of body parts in time and space. Manipulation is very different from motivation, however. Manipulation involves one person doing something to someone else in order to control his or her actions or attitude. Conversely, motivation comes from within. It's a welling desire to invest oneself in a topic, person, or activity."", 'In childcare centers, education administrators are the “villagers” who oversee children’s daily activities, design programs for learning and fun, and supervise staff and budgets. This career is all about inspiring children’s love for learning. While some administrators work directly with children, most focus on developing curriculum and activities and managing the preschool or daycare facility. Education administrators visit classrooms regularly. They ensure that equipment and spaces are clean and that children are engaged. Hiring, training, and supervising staff are other important parts of the job. Parent communication is also key; administrators meet with parents to discuss their children’s needs and progress, and to work together on solving any behavior or learning issues. Administrators develop budgets and allocate program funds, review relevant state regulations, and establish policies to meet them. To ensure safety at their center, directors and assistants often share the responsibility of being available during all open hours.', '1. Manipulation\nParticipation as manipulation occurs when children and youth do not understand the issues motivating a participatory process or their role in that process. In Hart’s words: “ Sometimes adults feel that the end justifies the means…. If children have no understanding of the issues and hence do not understand their actions, then this is manipulation. Such manipulation under the guise of participation is hardly an appropriate way to introduce children into democratic political processes.” Examples include “pre-school children carrying political placards concerning the impact of social policies on children” when those children do not understand the issues or their role in the political process, and asking children “to make drawings of something, such as their ideal playground,” after which “adults collect the drawings and in some hidden manner synthesize the ideas to come up with ‘the children’s design’ for a playground. The process of analysis is not shared with the children and is usually not even made transparent to other adults. The children have no idea how their ideas were used.” 2.', 'Administration has exciting leadership opportunities, which often play large roles in forming curriculums, goals, budgets, timelines, state regulations, mandated testing, as well as performance measures to ensure all educators are able to meet personal and professional goals. Together, administrators and faculty will carve a path to success for all. Successful administrators form distinguished teams to support the goals and aspirations of students. With the assistance of vice principles, goals can be further achieved with greater outcome and acceptance. Administrators often learn techniques to relate to children of all ages, of all backgrounds. Having the capability to relate to children is not only essential to administrators, but also vital to the overall success of school districts and standardized testing. School districts must regulate per guidelines set forth at local, state and federal levels. Administrators must remain active in continuing education programs, often returning to leadership programs such as a doctoral degree. A master’s degree is generally earned prior to entering an administrators role but this depends greatly on the school district and demand for administrators. Administrators are leaders who take pride in their strategic planning, tremendous support in every sector, respect for the education system, including faculty, students, parents, and school board members.', 'An educational administrator ensures a safe and productive learning environment for the students and faculty at their institution.

This manipulation can occur when educational goals and methods are not clearly communicated to students, leading them to participate in activities without a full understanding of their purpose or implications, as depicted by the manipulation of participation described by Hart. Administrators might use their roles in deciding curriculums, activities, and even the representation of student feedback (e.g., using children's drawings or ideas without their full understanding or consent in decision-making processes) to direct student behavior or attitudes in ways that align with the administrators' goals or the institution's needs, sometimes under the guise of participation or engagement.;['Creating pressure for high test scores', 'Manipulate curriculum to match tests', 'Using rewards and punishments to control behavior', 'Using grading to create fear and anxiety', 'Promoting conformity and respect for authority', 'Control classroom content and methods', 'Place students in inappropriate classes', 'Spread rumors, social exclusion, intimidation', 'Reinforce social inequality through assignments', 'Pressuring students towards specific careers', 'Restrict parents from decision-making', 'Exploit parent-school collaboration', 'Over-involvement in student work', 'Use power to control classroom discourse', 'Ignoring qualitative feedback', 'Focusing solely on quantitative results', 'Creating self-fulfilling prophecies through labeling', 'Teaching to the test', 'Zero-tolerance policies disproportionately affect minorities', 'Emphasis on standardized testing neglects other skills', 'High-stakes testing diminishes joy of learning'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay'];['partial_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.1875

As an example an older offender is less likely to re-offend.', 'All Reported Cases of Female Sex-Offenders\nArticles > Female Sex Offender Cases\nReported Cases of Female sex Offenders\nIt is generally known that female sex offenders receive more lenient sentences than their male counterparts (Embry et al, Sex-Based Sentencing: Sentencing Discrepancies Between Male and Female Sex Offenders. Feminist Criminology, 2012;7 (2):146-162), are subject to fewer prison assaults, and are granted earlier release on parole. While the former decision is made by the courts, and arguably open to possible court bias, the latter decision is made by correctional officials, and based on relatively reliable results from the research. Even though sexual victimization by either males or females is a traumatizing experience, female offenders are not as dangerous as male offenders, and combine the act with fewer aggravating circumstances, such as weapon possession, kidnapping, and violence. Perhaps because of this, more cases of female sex offending go unreported. See domestic abuse for a more detailed look at rates of female victimization by men. According to psychologist Anna C. Salter, female sex offenders fall into three groups: the first group often victimizes their own biological children, mostly those under the age of six; the second group, called the ""teacher/lover"" group, have sex with children in the groups they are involved with, are usually around 30 years old and having sex with kids about 15 years old (portrayed in the 2006 movie ""Notes On A Scandal"", featuring Cate Blanchett as a teacher who has an affair with a 15-year-old male student);', 'The third category is represented by the “Experimental/Exploiter”. This woman is a lone perpetrator targeting within a babysitting context some young male children. The fourth category is the “Teacher/Lover”. This is a lone woman perpetrator falling in love with a teenager male. Female sex offenders differ in several ways from males, besides these categories. When they are serial, they do not abuse the same high number of victims that men do, and women are rarely repeating offenders. Women rarely attack or stalk random teenagers or children. Women offenders often develop or feed off of a so-called relationship to their victim and they consider this relationship as being love. Women sex offenders also end up seeing themselves and their victims on a peer-to-peer basis. Here is a list of the most notorious female paedophiles in existence to date:', 'Sex Offenders, the Static-99 Form and Re-offending\nSex Offenders, the Static-99 Form and Re-offending\nWhile it remains impossible to determine exactly whether a sex offender will re offend statistically there are underlying factors that point to the sex offenders risk profile in relation to re offending (or recidivism). North Carolina State uses a form (static-99) to assist in trying to determine the risk profile of a male sex offender. This is a form that originated in Canada and the questionnaire is fairly standardised. The form is also used widely in The U.S. and Europe. The risk level determined correlates to the monitoring and supervision post release or while on probation. No relevant assessment is applied to female sex offenders due to negligible numbers.

Clinical and forensic psychologist Jackie Craissati adds an additional dimension to these three, involving the adolescent female perpetrator, who often comes from a very disturbed background (). Male victims of female sexual abuse often suffer from many of the same conditions experienced by female victims of male abusers: chronic difficulties in maintaining relationships, severe depression and substance abuse. The parents of the boys who were sexually abused by Sue Reschke in 2013 reported that their sons started showing signs of behavioral and academic problems after the abuse took place.']";Female sex offenders exhibit risk factors in distinct ways that may differ from their male counterparts. First, these offenders often develop or perceive a relationship with their victims, viewing it as a form of love, which can influence their patterns of offending. The types of relationships formed can vary, such as mothers abusing their biological children, teachers engaging in relationships with students, or caretakers exploiting their roles (e.g., babysitters). These dynamics suggest not only a potential for under-reporting due to the personal and relational context of the offenses but also complicate the assessment of risk and recidivism, as traditional models like the Static-99 form focus mainly on factors more commonly associated with male offenders. This context-specific approach by female offenders shows that risk assessments and interventions need to be tailored to understand and address the unique motivations and circumstances of female sex offenders.;['Manipulation and coercion are common tactics', 'Subtle grooming behaviors, often overlooked', 'Use of nurturing roles to mask abuse', 'Lower physical aggression than male offenders', 'Exploitation of power dynamics in relationships', 'Targeting known children or peers', 'Victims often female', 'Recidivism rates generally lower than males', 'Childhood trauma significantly increases risk', 'Substance abuse and mental health issues prevalent', 'Underreporting due to implicit gender bias', 'Gender-responsive risk assessments crucial', 'Solo offending more common than males', 'Financial exploitation and fraud more common', 'Self-harm or running away for manipulation', 'Promiscuity or sex for gain may be present', 'Often accomplices to male offenders', 'Predisposed, coerced, teacher/lover categories', 'Risk factors include age at release, relationship history', 'Lenient sentencing sometimes observed', '40% involved in domestic abuse', '35% of girls in detention experienced sexual abuse'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['not_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.25

At the individual level, researchers have explored how early career experiences exert a lasting effect on people’s careers or job titles (a process known as career imprinting or position imprints, respectively). For example, experiences in a particular type of (munificent or scarce) resource environment early in one\'s career or organizational tenure might influence subsequent work styles and job performance.

The founders indoctrinate and socialize these employees to their way of thinking and feeling. Finally the founders’ own behavior acts as a role model that encourages employees to identify with them and thereby internalize their beliefs, values, and assumptions. But, this only really works in the early stages of organization’s growth.

It has become so large that they lose touch with it. It’s not their baby any more. Then the new owners come in and start the entire process again. Some may say the new owners have an advantage as they can free up the futures of the existing employees and being in one’s that model their values.

These critics, including legal scholars, have noted that the decisions in cases like Oliphant v. Schlie and subsequent related cases have often been based on selective historical interpretations or ignored evidence contrary to the court’s rulings. They argue that these decisions reflect a continuation of colonialist attitudes and undermine the sovereignty of tribal governments, thereby affecting how tribal rights are executed and perceived in legal contexts.

A major reason for this disparity is the apparent capturing of Indigenous self-understanding in the United States (and not only in American history classes). The substitution of ""Native American"" for ""American Indian"" may actually deepen the problem. Everyone knows the Indigenous Peoples are not Indians. Not so many know they are also not Americans. A survey of American Indian college and high-school students, reported in Native Americas[Winter, 1997], indicated that more than 96% of the youth identified themselves with their Indian nation, and more than 40% identified themselves solely in those terms. Only a little more than half identified themselves as American citizens. This survey is an example of the usefulness of the ""incorrect"" label ""Indian"" to explain something significant about indigenous self-identification. It\'s been asked ,""What\'s in a name?"" Sometimes the answer is everything, as when the name is Rumplestiltskin;', ""The care of the elderly, impoverished, and the sick is often delegated to some type of institutional care, whether private or governmental. 8. Native Americans see themselves as part of a large social unit (such as an extended family) and are much more supportive of each other's needs than in the Western culture. Native Americans do not need to be reminded to meet their brother's or sister's needs. They do it instinctively. They feed each other, clothe the poor, provide shelter, and quickly provide other emergency needs. 9. Native Americans have a very spiritual outlook on life. Although there is much variation of the spiritual expression within the different tribes, there are some common expressions. All Indian tribes believe in one Supreme Being."", 'The removal of tribes from their homelands has destroyed many traditions that were tied to sacred areas, causing many Natives to lose the unique understanding of their world as embodied in their former religious rituals. Many Native organizations and non-Native advocates are working hard to preserve the languages and cultural practices of tribes, and there has been some improvement in the past few decades. 4 Self-Hatred\nSo far, you have a population that has dealt with genocide, colonialism, relocation, poverty, high suicide rates, unemployment, and a predisposition to addiction. Is it any wonder that there is some self-loathing that goes with that? One Native man who wrote an article about his self-hatred for The Huffington Post stated, “I am simply admitting that, despite my efforts to discard my damaging thought processes, I hold deeply-rooted prejudiced views about my own people, and indeed about myself.” The trauma that many modern-day Native Americans and their ancestors have lived through can result in depression. Even in many educational institutions today, the Native American genocide is still not openly discussed or recognized. Especially with the loss of traditional values and a lack of strong cultural identity, Native American children are more prone to self-esteem issues than their Caucasian peers. Of the few mental health studies conducted on Native populations, results have shown that the rates of those suffering from depression in Native American communities can range anywhere from 10 to 30 percent. The Native concept of psychological health is holistic and can be expressed via phys', 'Language is also seen as an important part of identity, and learning Native languages, especially for youth in a community, is an important part in tribal survival. Some Indian artists find traditional definitions especially important. Crow poet Henry Real Bird offers his own definition, ""An Indian is one who offers tobacco to the ground, feeds the water, and prays to the four winds in his own language."" Pulitzer Prize-winning Kiowa author N. Scott Momaday gives a definition that is less spiritual but still based in the traditions and experience of a person and their family, ""An Indian is someone who thinks of themselves as an Indian. But that\'s not so easy to do and one has to earn the entitlement somehow. You have to have a certain experience of the world in order to formulate this idea. I consider myself an Indian; I\'ve had the experience of an Indian. I know how my father saw the world, and his father before him."" Constructed as an imagined community\nSome social scientists relate the uncertainty of Native American identity to the theory of the constructed nature of identity.', 'Native American Life - Love of Nature and Strength of Spirit\nNative American Life\nNative American life today incorporates many traditional values with a changing lifestyle. Native American life is different today than it was centuries ago, but there is still a great degree of pride and independence in Native American life. Pride in one’s tribe, care of the land and respect for nature characterize native American life, and many Native Americans share these principles today. Although the history of American Indians on the continent has in later years has included many sad events, Native American pride still remains and Native American life is ideally filled with pride for one’s roots and love of nature. Many Native Americans today live on reservations, but in generations past, they spanned the continent and their lifestyles and traditions varied from tribe to tribe as they do today. Some Native Americans survived by hunting and gathering and lived in tents, while others lived in complex longhouses and had a very organized and complex political system. Before white settlers came to the continent, Native American life was free of European influences, and Native Americans lived simply off the land. They were not yet acquainted with the serious diseases that would later claim many lives, as Europeans brought smallpox against which Native American populations lacked resistance. Although there was often cooperation between tribes regarding farming and trade, other tribes were continuously at war with each other, such as the Algonquin and the Iroquois. However, the Iroquois would often incorporated conquered tribes into their sophisticated political system and thus enlarge their nation.']";Native Americans hold a complex set of feelings about their identity, greatly influenced by their historical and cultural experiences. According to the passage, a significant majority of Native American youth strongly identify with their specific tribes, with over 40% identifying exclusively in tribal terms, and just slightly more than half see themselves as American citizens. This strong tribal identification suggests a deep connection to their heritage and cultural roots, despite challenges such as historical trauma and ongoing issues like poverty and self-esteem struggles, which can also foster feelings of self-loathing and a high incidence of depression within the community.;['Pride in heritage', 'Strong tribal identity', 'Cultural connectedness', 'Spiritual and cultural beliefs', 'Traditional and contemporary blend of life', 'Importance of family bonds', 'Diverse experiences and perspectives', 'Continued cultural preservation efforts', 'Complex relationship with American identity', 'Efforts to combat negative stereotypes', 'Pain from historical trauma', 'Generational trauma', 'Impact of trauma on self-esteem', 'Cultural loss and alienation', 'Desire for accurate representation', 'Varying preferred terminology', 'Importance of accurate terminology', 'Resilience and survival', 'Dual identity challenges', 'Misunderstanding from non-Natives', 'High suicide rates among youth', 'Socioeconomic hardship', 'Discrimination and marginalization', 'Anxiety and depression', 'Race-related stress', 'Efforts to reclaim identity'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital'];['support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support'];0.6666666666666666

In Western industrialized nations like the U.S., people tend to think of masculinity and femininity in dichotomous terms, viewing men and women as distinctly different and opposites. Other cultures, however, challenge this assumption and have less distinct views of masculinity and femininity. For example, historically there was a category of people in the Navajo culture called berdaches, who were anatomically normal men but who were defined as a third gender considered to fall between male and female. Berdaches married other ordinary men (not Berdaches), although neither was considered homosexual, as they would be in today’s Western culture. What this suggests is that we learn gender through the process of socialization. For many people, this process begins before they are even born, with parents selecting gendered names on the basis of the sex of a fetus, and by decorating the incoming baby's room and selecting its toys and clothes in color-coded and gendered ways that reflect cultural expectations and stereotypes. Then, from infancy on, we are socialized by family, educators, religious leaders, peer groups, and the wider community, who teach us what is expected from us in terms of appearance and behavior based on whether they code us as a boy or a girl. Media and popular culture play important roles in teaching us gender too. One result of gender socialization is the formation of gender identity, which is one’s definition of oneself as a man or woman."", 'However, in many Middle Eastern, Asian, and African cultures, dresses or skirts (often referred to as sarongs, robes, or gowns) are considered masculine. The kilt worn by a Scottish male does not make him appear feminine in his culture. The dichotomous view of gender (the notion that someone is either male or female) is specific to certain cultures and is not universal. In some cultures gender is viewed as fluid. In the past, some anthropologists used the term berdache to refer to individuals who occasionally or permanently dressed and lived as a different gender. The practice has been noted among certain Native American tribes (Jacobs, Thomas, and Lang 1997). Samoan culture accepts what Samoans refer to as a “third gender.” Fa’afafine, which translates as “the way of the woman,” is a term used to describe individuals who are born biologically male but embody both masculine and feminine traits. Fa’afafines are considered an important part of Samoan culture. Individuals from other cultures may mislabel them as homosexuals because fa’afafines have a varied sexual life that may include men and women (Poasa 1992).', 'Caitlin’s sketch depicts a ceremonial dance among the Sac and Fox Indians to celebrate the two-spirit person.

To make another planet sustain life (at least as we know it), we’re going to need these elements as a bare minimum requirement. For colonizing other areas, large-scale life support systems would be needed to maintain living conditions for humans — created through a process known as terraforming. This is will be possible inside an enclosed biosphere, which must be made of durable and robust materials. These locales will enable humans to grow food and sustain life. Until a colony is self-sustaining, it might rely on food supplies sent from Earth. Why? The reasons are obvious if you think about it. Famed physicist Stephen Hawking has outlined the need for planet colonization multiple times. Space colonization will ensure the future of our species, especially when armed conflicts all over the planet could lead to our downfall.', ""Advertisement\nThe requirements themselves are pretty straightforward. For one, we need liquid water. Water dissolves and transports chemicals, causing important metabolic reactions. We also need energy to create and sustain life, so light energy (from a warm sun and atmosphere) or chemical energy (from chemical reactions) needs to be present. Nutrients are required to build and maintain life. A planet with a water cycle, habitable atmosphere or volcanic activity can replenish and circulate nutrients [source: Lunar Planetary Institute ]. So it may seem like the chances are small that we'll find another planet that supports life in our universe. Those are pretty specific requirements, after all -- maybe there's one? Two?"", 'We can live on other planets. It\'s just that we need a very large amount of technology and supplies in order to do so. Currently, the cost of this support is too large for us to feasibly establish a colony on another world, and there are no locations we have yet discovered which do not require extensive life support just to get there, let alone to live there. Terraforming is one procedure that might circumvent this. Terraforming is the act of altering a planet\'s ecosystem in order to be more like Earth. Some extreme examples imagine turning Mars or Venus into ""second Earths"" complete with oceans and atmospheres, but this is a bit of a stretch. Mars lacks important features, such as an active magnetic field, that would be necessary for habitability and cannot be engineered through current human technology. However, terraforming could create localized regions in which human life is, at least, more generously supported than the rest of the planet. For example, living underground on Mars would be a lot easier than living on the surface, or trying to alter the entire planet.

Astronomers do not limit themselves to our Solar System either, suggesting that we should look at different solar systems. Scientists are planning to use interferometry–an investigative technique that implements lasers, which is used in astronomy as well as other fields– to find planets in the habitable zones of other solar systems. Astronomers believe that there are hundreds of solar systems and thousands of planets, which means that statistically the odds are favorable for finding another planet that supports life. While NASA develops better probes, the search for life continues. There are a number of sites with more information including life on other planets from Groninger Kapteyn Institute astronomy students and NASA predicts non-green plants on other planets from NASA. Universe Today has a number of articles concerning life on other planets including searching for life on non-Earth like planets and single species ecosystem gives hope for life on other planets.

For human beings to live and thrive, conditions have to be “just right,"" like they are on Earth. For example, humans could never survive the overwhelming heat on Mercury or the frigid cold on Neptune. Other conditions, such as poisonous gases and lack of water, also prevent other planets from being good hosts for life. Armed with this knowledge, scientists have long believed that life might be found elsewhere in the universe on planets similar to Earth orbiting other stars. For example, if we could find another star with a planetary system orbiting it that had a planet similar in size and location to Earth, perhaps it, too, would have those “just right"" conditions for life as we know it. Many of these theories predated our ability to test them. With recent developments in technology, however, scientists are looking farther and farther into space…and learning some interesting things!

Scientists have just started to publish their findings from the data obtained from the Kepler telescope\'s many observations.']";To support life on other planets, a multifaceted approach is required, beginning with identifying planets that mimic Earth's essential living conditions, such as liquid water, suitable temperatures, and necessary nutrients for biochemical functions. Large-scale life support systems need to be developed for sustaining human life, utilizing advanced technologies for environmental control and resource management, possibly through processes like terraforming to modify a planet's conditions to be more Earth-like.

Self-Esteem: Life is filled with moments of bad luck, hardship, sorrow and setbacks. Overcoming adversity teaches us to be strong, survive and even thrive under the challenges of life.

When we face difficulty and disaster head-on and with fearlessness, we strengthen our self-esteem and develop self-confidence.

Resilience is a person’s ability to bounce back from adversity and grow from the challenge, and research now shows that past adversity can help you persevere in the face of current stress. Mark Seery and his colleagues studied a group of more than 2,300 people by asking them to report their lifetime exposure to a list of negative events grouped into seven categories. What they discovered is that people who experienced a moderate level of adversity reported better mental health and well-being and higher life satisfaction over time compared to both those groups who reported a high history of adversity and those with no history of adversity. Past struggles can help you become more resilient in the following five ways: They increase empathy. Leading and living with empathy has never been more important in our world than right now. Empathy is the ability to identify with the challenges that other people face and to see those challenges from their perspective.', 'People who are more resilient are capable of adapting to adversity. Resilient people can manage the stress caused by life changes, whether they are large or less significant. In fact, it has been found that people who can better overcome short and less intense moments of tension, usually can also handle more intense crises with greater ease. This means that being resilient in your day to day develops your abilities to face greater problems and catastrophes. Up to a certain extent, emotional and physical resilience is innate, but it is also a skill that can be developed. Naturally, some people are upset less by changes and can roll with the punches better. This ability can be seen during childhood, and tends to remain stable throughout the years. Emotional resilience is also related to certain factors that are not under our control, such as age, sex and exposure to trauma. However, resilience can be developed with a bit of effort. Traits of emotional resilience\nResilience is not a fixed quality.', 'For instance, if you do not have enough built-up resilience or experience in dealing with difficulty, adversity can crush you. On the other hand, if do you have sufficient resilience, then indeed it will make you stronger. How so, you ask? Resilience like any muscle is built up gradually and exponentially with repeated exposure to obstacles. If you lack practice in confronting obstacles (as when you choose to avoid them), one traumatic event can take you down. To underscore this point, developmental research has shown that traumatized children are more, rather than less, likely to be traumatized again. Likewise, those who grow up in tough neighborhoods become weaker, not stronger, and are more likely to struggle in life. 5. Take inspiration and learn from others who have dealt successfully with adversity. There are many inspiring stories of people who overcame seemingly insurmountable odds.'];Adversity enhances resilience primarily by providing experiences that develop coping mechanisms and emotional fortitude. First, moderate levels of adversity are shown to improve mental health and life satisfaction, teaching individuals to navigate challenges more effectively over time. Secondly, facing adversities builds empathy, allowing individuals to better understand and relate to the struggles of others, an essential component of resilient behavior. Lastly, through adversity, people often experience post-traumatic growth, which involves transforming a negative experience into a driver for personal development, thereby enhancing problem-solving skills and self-esteem in future challenges. Each of these aspects contributes to a stronger, more resilient self, capable of handling future adversity with greater ease and confidence.;['Overcoming challenges strengthens resilience.', 'Learning from setbacks builds resilience.', 'Resilience involves bouncing back stronger.', 'Repeated adversity builds coping skills.', 'Effective stress management builds resilience.', 'Strong social support enhances resilience.', 'Positive reframing of adversity promotes resilience.', 'Maintaining a positive outlook is vital for resilience.', 'Hope and optimism are key components of resilience.', 'Purpose and meaning energize perseverance.', 'Self-confidence increases after overcoming adversity.', 'Perspective shifts from threat to challenge.', 'Proactive problem-solving enhances resilience.', 'Developing coping skills increases resilience.', 'Choosing positive responses to adversity builds resilience.', 'Adversity builds resilience by fostering growth.', 'Resilience is developed through experience.', 'Brain plasticity allows adaptation to challenges.', 'Internal resources foster resilience.', 'Accepting adversity is key to personal growth.'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support'];0.5714285714285714

Based on this and prior studies ( Environ. Hlth. Perspect. 2009), Hamilton and colleagues posit that exposure to low levels of arsenic may act as a predisposing factor, in which a second stress is needed to induce adverse health affects. In this study, pregnancy and lactation acted as that secondary stress. In the prior study, Hamilton’s group demonstrated that arsenic suppressed immune function, leading to dramatically greater effects of a flu infection in mice. Offspring are also uniquely sensitive to environmental chemicals because “they are developing rapidly. It’s not hard for very low doses of a chemical to have big effects on a developing animal,” Hamilton says. In the current study, the mothers who were exposed to arsenic had significantly lower triglyceride concentrations in their serum and breast milk than normal, indicating the process of fat metabolism and storage in their bodies was compromised.', 'Mothers who ingested this medication who were carrying a four to six week old embryo had higher rates of births with limb deformities, heart damage, kidney and genital deformities (Berk, 2008). The manners in which Teratogens impact the developing human vary. Caffeine, smoking, drugs, stress, and inadequate nutrition are all related to physical development (Department). In fact, statistics reveal that forty five percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage (Department). Not all of these are related to Teratogens; however, that number is staggering. One study found that the age of the mother is relevant to development of the fetus, and the younger age increases the risk of healthy infants (Department). Rresearch also indicates that mothers in their twenties are at a higher risk for poor prenatal care and malnutrition (Department). Thus, one has to wonder if the threat of Teratogens counters the increase in health relative to a younger birthing age. The impact of stress has been studied in animals and humans (Department).', '© CBM Early childhood development is a period of great opportunity, but also one of great vulnerability. Many children cannot realise their full potential because of adverse conditions in their environment. For example, evidence from Pakistan showed that children who receive little sensory stimulation in their rural homes are vulnerable to stunting, low-weight and decreased psychomotor development. 6 Factors like inadequate nutrition, environmental toxins, unstable caregiving, limited stimulation and stress can all negatively impact on a child’s development. Children living in poverty and fragile living conditions, such as war or displacement, are particularly vulnerable to inadequate development. 3,7 These adverse childhood experiences may also cluster and be compounded over time. For instance, a child living in poverty is more likely to experience stress, malnutrition and unstable caregiving, all of which negatively impact on child development. Adverse effects to child development in the first years of life can have life-long consequences and can negatively impact on school readiness and learning potential, mental and physical health as an adult, resilience to stress and resolving conflict, as well as depleted family resources and inter-generational poverty. 8 However, recovery is possible with appropriate intervention and support. Investment in child development policies and programmes will result in long-term returns, as children with adequate support in their early years are healthier, better educated and more likely to contribute to society and the global economy.']";Arsenic has significant negative impacts on development, particularly when exposure occurs in utero or during early childhood. Studies have shown that arsenic exposure can lead to developmental effects such as adverse pregnancy outcomes, infant mortality, and increases in mortality from various diseases in young adults. Additionally, exposure to arsenic has been linked to decreased cognitive development, intelligence, and memory, highlighting its profound effects on child health and development.;['Prenatal arsenic exposure harms fetal brain development.', 'Arsenic exposure impairs cognitive development in children.', 'High arsenic exposure may cause birth defects.', 'Chronic arsenic exposure causes developmental delays and reduced intelligence.', 'Arsenic exposure increases risk of developmental issues and behavioral problems.', 'Children are more vulnerable to arsenic’s developmental effects.', 'Developmental effects vary by arsenic type and exposure level.', 'Inorganic arsenic is more toxic than organic arsenic.', 'Low arsenic levels still affect child development.', 'Arsenic exposure linked to lower IQ scores and developmental delays.', 'Arsenic exposure linked to miscarriages and stillbirths.', 'Arsenic affects fetal nervous system development.', 'Early arsenic exposure linked to cognitive problems.'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital'];['support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support'];0.5555555555555556

With the recent arrival of several effective drugs for both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, research on bee venom as an arthritis remedy has slowed to a trickle, and we may never be sure whether many stings are better than no stings at all. When it comes to multiple sclerosis, the picture is still hazier. Nobody knows how bee venom affects the disease in humans, and studies on laboratory animals have only just begun. One very small human study was published in 2005 in the journal Neurology, but scientists concluded that bee sting therapy did not reduce disease activity, disability, or fatigue and did not improve quality of life. Researchers at M.C.P. Hahnemann University in Philadelphia recently started giving bee venom to mice with a disease similar to MS. The preliminary results suggest that the venom doesn\'t diminish any MS symptoms in mice; in fact, some of the mice treated with bee venom displayed symptoms more severe than those of mice that got no treatment at all. Claims that bee venom can ameliorate other diseases, including fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and depression, are based entirely on personal observation and not on science.

How going green impacts our body, mind, and relationships\nGoing green has huge effects on our body, mind, relationships, and the world around us in many ways. Our environment can either increase or reduce stress; hence impact the body. The things we see, experience or hear can change our mood and how our immune, endocrine, and nervous system function. A stressful environment causes anxiety which in turn elevates blood pressure, muscle tension, and heart rate and going green reverses these impacts.

If we can’t go green for our own health, what can we do it for? 9. Improve your Skin\nIn relation to skin products, going green means using more natural products and these are definitely much healthier for your skin. Your skin is the largest organ of the human body. It protects everything within. More than that, it is a living tissue system that can absorb applied products. That is why when we use products heavy with harmful chemicals, they absorb into our skin, reach our bloodstream and can cause damage bit by bit that can lead to dermatitis, allergies and skin irritations. As a result, choosing natural skincare or green make-up is a no brainer, because you avoid petroleum, and all those synthetic ingredients that prevent your skin from working properly, from regenerating, or healing properly.', '9. Eat Green\nGreens, greens and more greens. The more you eat them, the more your tastebuds change and you realize just how delicious food from the earth truly is. The lighter you feel, the better your skin looks, the more energy you have. It’s so easy to slack on healthy eating whenever we’re feeling down or overwhelmed, which only makes us feel worse. Stop and remind yourself to nourish your body, no matter what, and you’ll be able to take empowered steps forward. 10.

First, engaging in activities like hiking and building shelters as part of green therapy boosts physical health by increasing physical activity, which can lower risks of heart attacks, manage weight, and improve metabolic health. Additionally, a natural environment reduces stress, alleviating anxiety, muscle tension, and high blood pressure, and enhances emotional health by providing a serene setting that helps in dealing with pain and discomfort.

The resulting stress of these emotions can create havoc within our bodies. If we had a physical illness before our loved one died, our grief can exacerbate the existing illness. It can also open the way for physical illness if we have been previously healthy. Grief makes us susceptible to diseases such as the common cold sore throats and other infections.

By exploring previously ignored writers and studying the women\'s literary tradition, critics hope to unveil previously held assumptions that marginalize the place of women in society. Textual Analysis\nAnother popular approach to feminist literary criticism is to examine closely what the text says, or as the case may be, does not say. In other words, what the text leaves out says much about the writer, literature in general, and society as a whole. By using this ""hermeneutics of suspicion"" literary critics hope to reveal how women are marginalized in the language of literature, according to Ady. In some ways, this approach to literary criticism assumes that there is an unconscious transference of previously held assumptions to the text through the act of writing. What is written reveals what society believes. Influenced by the rise of post-modernism, feminist literary critics believe that the act of writing is not neutral, instead it is influenced by the values of the writer who then transfers those values to the text, often unintentionally. By understanding these values, feminist literary critics hope to reveal these subconscious ideas to show how women have been marginalized in literature. References\n""Feminist Literary Criticism:', 'Traditionally, feminist literary criticism has sought to examine old texts within literary canon through a new lens. Specific goals of feminist criticism include both the development and discovery of female tradition of writing, and rediscovering of old texts, while also interpreting symbolism of women\'s writing so that it will not be lost or ignored by the male point of view and resisting sexism inherent in the majority of mainstream literature. These goals, along with the intent to analyze women writers and their writings from a female perspective, and increase awareness of the sexual politics of language and style were developed by Lisa Tuttle in the 1980s, and have since been adopted by a majority of feminist critics. The history of feminist literary criticism is extensive, from classic works of nineteenth-century women authors such as George Eliot and Margaret Fuller to cutting-edge theoretical work in women\'s studies and gender studies by "" third-wave "" authors. Before the 1970s—in the first and second waves of feminism—feminist literary criticism was concerned with women\'s authorship and the representation of women\'s condition within the literature; in particular the depiction of fictional female characters. In addition, feminist literary criticism is concerned with the exclusion of women from the literary canon, with theorists such as Lois Tyson suggesting that this is because the views of women authors are often not considered to be universal. Additionally, feminist criticism has been closely associated with the birth and growth of queer studies. Modern feminist literary theory seeks to understand both the literary portrayals and representation of both women and people in the queer community, expanding the role of a variety of identities and analysis within feminist literary criticism. Contents\n1 Methods employed\n2 History and critics\n3 Modern applications\n4 References\n4.1 Further reading\n5 External links\nMethods employed\nFeminist scholarship has developed a variety of ways to unpack literature in order to understand its essence through a feminist lens.', 'For example, feminist criticism and historical documents can be used to interpret the short story “The Story of an Hour” by Kate Chopin and show that in the late 1800s, although both men and women were bound by moral and social conventions, men were allowed more sexual freedom and control over their individual destiny. Entertainment and Feminist Criticism\nFilm critics use feminist criticism to show how mainstream Hollywood exploits stereotypical gender roles for commercial viability in films such as “Legally Blonde.” Feminist film critics also look for changing gender concepts such as gender neutral attitudes and role reversals, including heroines who fiercely challenge stereotypical gender roles in harshly patriarchal cultures. Harvard Crimson writer Tarina Quraishi says the film “The Hunger Games” reveals characters with nontraditional gender roles and shows “there is nothing inherently masculine about aggression or feminine about passivity."" Culture and Sexual Politics\nFeminist critics investigate cultural expressions of all forms, including linguistics, visual art and popular texts, using the concept of dominant discourse. Dominant discourse refers to the power dynamics that control the written, spoken and behavioral expectations imposed upon society and culture by those in power. One way that women writers contribute to dominant discourse is by showing how patriarchy misrepresents the emotional and sexual experiences of women and by exploring new narrative strategies that help reshape sexual politics. Cultural views on morality are “a product of books and movies like Fifty Shades of Grey ,” according to The Atlantic journalist Anna Green. Feminist critics say the novel shows “the terrible communication” between males and females. Controversies and the Future\nIt is common knowledge that the traditional work of women is devalued and women still make less money than men in many commercial enterprises at the time of publication.', 'Embodying or Undercutting Stereotypes\nFeminist literary criticism recognizes that literature both reflects and shapes stereotypes and other cultural assumptions. Thus, feminist literary criticism examines how works of literature embody patriarchal attitudes or undercut them, sometimes both happening within the same work. Feminist theory and various forms of feminist critique began long before the formal naming of the school of literary criticism. In so-called first-wave feminism, the ""Woman\'s Bible,"" written in the late 19th century by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, is an example of a work of criticism firmly in this school, looking beyond the more obvious male-centered outlook and interpretation. PhotoQuest / Getty Images\nDuring the period of second-wave feminism, academic circles increasingly challenged the male literary canon. Feminist literary criticism has since intertwined with postmodernism and increasingly complex questions of gender and societal roles. Tools of the Feminist Literary Critic\nFeminist literary criticism may bring in tools from other critical disciplines, such as historical analysis, psychology, linguistics, sociological analysis, and economic analysis. Feminist criticism may also look at intersectionality, looking at how factors including race, sexuality, physical ability, and class are also involved. Feminist literary criticism may use any of the following methods: Deconstructing the way that women characters are described in novels, stories, plays, biographies, and histories, especially if the author is male\nDeconstructing how one\'s own gender influences how one reads and interprets a text, and which characters and how the reader identifies depending on the reader\'s gender\nDeconstructing how women autobiographers and biographers of women treat their subjects, and how biographers treat women who are secondary to the main subject\nDescribing relationships between the literary text and ideas about power and sexuality and gender\nCritique of patriarchal or woman-marginalizing language, such as a ""universal"" use of the masculine pronouns ""he"" and ""him""\nNoticing and unpacking differences in how men and women write:', 'Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our terms and conditions of fair use. Feminist Criticism (1960s-present)\nSummary: This resource will help you begin the process of understanding literary theory and schools of criticism and how they are used in the academy. Feminist criticism is concerned with ""the ways in which literature (and other cultural productions) reinforce or undermine the economic, political, social, and psychological oppression of women"" (Tyson 83). This school of theory looks at how aspects of our culture are inherently patriarchal (male dominated) and aims to expose misogyny in writing about women, which can take explicit and implicit forms. This misogyny, Tyson reminds us, can extend into diverse areas of our culture: "" Perhaps the most chilling example...is found in the world of modern medicine, where drugs prescribed for both sexes often have been tested on male subjects only"" (85). Feminist criticism is also concerned with less obvious forms of marginalization such as the exclusion of women writers from the traditional literary canon: ""... unless the critical or historical point of view is feminist, there is a tendency to underrepresent the contribution of women writers"" (Tyson 84). Common Space in Feminist Theories\nThough a number of different approaches exist in feminist criticism, there exist some areas of commonality.']";Joanna M Smith employs feminist criticism by engaging in a critical examination of literature and other cultural productions to reveal and challenge the oppression of women entrenched in these media. She focuses on how literature often reflects patriarchal values that marginalize and stereotype women, using feminist theory to analyze texts and expose misogynistic elements implicitly or explicitly present. Additionally, Smith looks at the exclusion of women from the literary canon and seeks to amplify the voices and writings of women through her critiques, shedding light on the ways that gender impacts literary interpretation and representation.;['No information on Joanna M.

Investigations of organizational justice tend to take a descriptive approach. As such, an event is treated as fair or unfair to the extent that one believes it to be so. In other words, justice research is concerned with identifying the antecedents that influence fairness judgments, as well as the consequences once such an evaluation has been made. Notice that this descriptive approach does not tell organizations what really is fair, only what people believe to be just. This empirical perspective complements the normative frameworks beneficially employed by philosophers whose prescriptive approach typically attempts to ascertain what is objectively right or wrong by using reasoned analysis. The sense of justice has a strong impact on workers’ behavior and attitudes. For example, perceived fairness promotes such benefits as organizational commitment, effective job performance, and increased organizational citizenship behavior. Justice also helps alleviate many of the ill effects of dysfunctional work environments.

For example, if you reduce your greenhouse gas emissions, there will be less climate change. To be sure, there still will be climate change. No one can prevent something as big as climate change without any collective action. But there will be less climate change, and that is something we can care about.', 'Module 4 - Individual and Collective Action \nModule 4 - Individual and Collective Action \nIntroduction\nAbout Module 4\nIn Module 3, we learned some basic ethical\xa0principles related to what actions we should take with respect to the environment. In this module, we’ll learn some fundamentals of actually achieving successful (or unsuccessful) actions. There are two main types of action: individual action and collective action. This module discusses both. In addition, through the Written Assignment associated with this module, we’ll\xa0address an imaginary situation where collective action is needed to avoid the depletion of natural resources. Note that a lot of what we’ll learn in this module is applicable to a broad range of actions, not just actions related to the environment. How can you get your roommates to keep your apartment clean? How can societies get everyone to contribute to public services? These topics and many others are informed by the content in Module 4.'];Lauren Oakes addresses the issue of individual action by highlighting the significance of personal decisions in contributing to large-scale social and environmental outcomes. She discusses the importance of individual actions, like choosing to walk instead of drive, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. Oakes acknowledges that while individual actions might seem small in the face of global challenges, they still make a meaningful difference, emphasizing that reductions in personal emissions contribute to less overall climate change.;"['Years of self-discipline achieved independence.', 'Conscious vigilance avoided dysfunctional relationships.', 'New social circle aided personal growth.', 'Marriage supported goals without control.', 'Individual effort crucial for personal change.', 'Individual actions impact environment significantly.', 'Personal choices matter; collective impact huge.', 'Sustainable living reduces environmental burden.', 'Voting influences environmental policies.', 'Individual responsibility strengthens environmental movement.']";['vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital'];['not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support'];0.5

A pervasive sense of hopelessness, defined in terms of pessimistic expectations about the future, is even more important than other forms of negative emotion, such as anger and depression, in predicting suicidal behavior (Weishaar & Beck, 1992). The suicidal person is convinced that absolutely nothing can be done to improve his or her situation; no one else can help. 6. The common internal attitude in suicide is ambivalence.', '4.

However, when they do something like drink alcohol, it can lower their inhibitions and essentially make them less fearful of following through with the act. Emotional states\nMany emotional states go hand-in-hand with someone making the decision to commit suicide. These usually include: anger, anxiety, agitation, and hopelessness (usually as a result of depression). Anger – Individuals who are extremely angry or hostile can be at increased risk for suicide. Anxiety – When a person deals with chronic anxiety and/or panic attacks, they may feel tormented by their mental and physical reactions. This increase in fear and general stress may lead someone to take the drastic action of suicide. Agitation – This is defined as a state of nervous excitement. People who feel agitated are often likely to also experience anxiety and anger.', 'Suicide offers oblivion. 3. The common stimulus (or information input) in suicide is intolerable psychological pain. Excruciating negative emotions - including shame, guilt, anger, fear, and sadness - frequently serve as the foundation for self-destructive behavior.

Among those ever hospitalized for treatment of depression, the rate of death by suicide is twice as high (4 percent). Among those hospitalized for depression because of suicidal ideation or suicide attempt, 6 percent eventually take their own life. About 60 percent of people who kill themselves have a mood disorder that s potentially treatable; younger persons who kill themselves often have a substance abuse disorder as well. Life events involving loss —a job, a relationship, one’s health—play a role, too. When does emotional pain become unbearable? Suicide, some observers believe, is less an attempt to end one’s own life than to escape the mental pain of endless negative thoughts, reliving life’s failures and defeats, enduring constant self-recrimination, and envisioning only bleakness ahead, which are the hallmarks of depression. Rejection of any kind—relationship breakup, the silence of a friend, social shunning— is one of the harshest experiences a human can endure and can create so much emotional agony that it is increasingly linked to suicide attempts among young adults. Studies show that the same areas of the brain that are activated by physical pain are activated when we experience rejection.']";Mismanaged emotions, particularly when they involve enduring negative psychological states such as hopelessness, anger, and anxiety, can significantly lead to increased suicide rates. Key to this process is the presence of a pervasive sense of hopelessness-helplessness, where individuals see no possible positive alteration to their dire circumstances, ultimately viewing suicide as the only escape from intolerable psychological pain which often includes shame, guilt, and fear. Furthermore, when individuals mismanage these emotions by failing to seek or obtain effective coping mechanisms or mental health support, the overwhelming emotional burden can increase the risk of suicidal behaviors, particularly in individuals with unmet high personal expectations or those experiencing major life stressors like job loss or relationship breakdowns.;['Unmanaged mental health issues strongly linked to suicide', 'Intolerable psychological pain fuels self-destructive acts', 'Emotional dysregulation increases suicide risk', 'Mismanaged emotions impair coping mechanisms', 'Hopelessness and helplessness predict suicidal behavior', 'Depression is a leading cause of suicide', 'Feeling worthless or guilty increases suicide risk', 'Extreme anger, anxiety, agitation raise suicide risk', 'Inability to cope with overwhelming events', 'Suppressed stress increases suicide risk', 'Relationship problems increase suicide risk', 'Life stressors contribute to suicide risk', 'Social isolation and loneliness increase suicide risk', 'Substance abuse increases suicide risk', 'Impulsivity and lack of self-control increase suicide risk', 'Untreated mental illness makes life unbearable', 'Mismanaged emotions disrupt healthy living', 'Lack of emotional support increases vulnerability', 'Perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness predict suicide', 'Suicide is a complex issue with multiple risk factors', 'Many suicides are associated with diagnosable mental disorders', 'Increased energy after depression can increase suicide risk', 'Trauma and victimization increase suicide risk', 'Unresolved grief increases suicide risk', 'Toxic shame exacerbates depression and suicidal thoughts', 'Mismanaged emotions lead to isolation and lack of support', 'Alcohol/drug abuse increases suicide risk', 'Firearm access increases suicide risk', 'Men more likely to die by suicide than women', 'Sudden mood changes signal increased risk'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital'];['support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.5294117647058824

Whether nudging yourself or someone else, it’s helpful to use reminders and prompts on a regular basis to keep target behaviors top of mind. Reframing negative thoughts as positive ones can boost motivation, and reducing the accessibility of temptations can prevent backsliding. Additionally, social pressure can be an effective tool to increase accountability for reaching one’s goals. Is nudging ethical? Created with Sketch. Nudges are generally cost-effective and simple to implement, but there is some debate over the ethics. Some argue that nudging can manipulate people into choices that they would not support, given time for reflection. Other ethical considerations include the nature of the defaults being offered, as well as the transparency of the motives and politics of the person or individual doing the nudging.', 'Putting fruit at eye level counts as a nudge. Banning junk food does not. In this form, drawing on behavioral economics, the nudge is more generally applied to influence behaviour. One of the most frequently cited examples of a nudge is the etching of the image of a housefly into the men\'s room urinals at Amsterdam\'s Schiphol Airport, which is intended to ""improve the aim"". Overview\nA nudge makes it more likely that an individual will make a particular choice, or behave in a particular way, by altering the environment so that automatic cognitive processes are triggered to favour the desired outcome. An individual\'s behaviour is not always in alignment with their intentions (termed a value-action gap ). It is common knowledge that humans are not fully rational beings; that is, people will often do something that is not in their own self-interest, even when they are aware that their actions are not in their best interest. As an example, when hungry, people who diet often underestimate their ability to lose weight, and their intentions to eat healthy can be temporarily weakened until they are satiated. Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman describes two distinct systems for processing information as to why people sometimes act against their own self-interest:', 'Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness (Yale University Press, 2008). Nudge discusses how public and private organizations can help people make better choices in their daily lives. "" People often make poor choices—and look back at them with bafflement!"" Thaler and Sunstein write. "" We do this because, as human beings, we all are susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of embarrassing blunders in education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, happiness, and even the planet itself."" Thaler and his co-author coined the term "" choice architecture ."" Thaler advocates for libertarian paternalism, which describes public and private social policies that lead people to make good and better decisions through ""nudges"" without depriving them of the freedom to choose or significantly changing their economic incentives. An example of this can be seen in Nudge through defaults in organ donation. In the United States, citizens must opt in to donate their organs, while in Australia, citizens must opt out if they do not wish to donate. Consequently, Australia has much higher rates of organ donation than does the United States.', 'To make matters worse, people are more likely to overlook the unethical behavior of others when it deteriorates gradually over time. For example, one of us (Francesca) found, with colleague Max Bazerman, that people who played the role of auditors in a simulated auditing task were much less likely to report those who gradually inflated their numbers over time than those who made more abrupt changes all at once, even though the level of inflation was eventually the same. Unfortunately, the assumption that unethical workplace behavior is the product of a few bad apples has blinded many organizations to the fact that we all can be negatively influenced by situational forces, even when we care a great deal about honesty. Yet approaches to warding off the slippery-slope problem need not to be drastic. In their book Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein illustrate how a small and unobtrusive nudge in the right direction can lead people to eat better, save more for retirement, and conserve energy. Our research similarly indicates that ethical nudges can help people avoid the types of indiscretions that might start them down the slippery slope.

In the context of nudges, such as ethical reminders or default settings, individuals might not engage deeply with the moral implications of their choices because the decision-making process is pre-framed or simplified for them. This could lead to a scenario where people rely more on the constructed choice architecture and less on their own ethical reasoning processes, possibly undermining their development and exercise of fully autonomous moral agency.;"['Nudges bypass conscious deliberation, weakening autonomy.', 'Manipulative nudges contradict personal values.', 'They undermine self-governance and moral development.', 'Cognitive biases exploited, limiting self-control.', 'Ethical reflection is bypassed, diminishing agency.', 'Over-reliance hinders moral growth, creating dependence.', 'Transparency crucial; lack thereof enables manipulation.', 'Nudges blur guidance and manipulation, eroding agency.', 'Habitual responses replace thoughtful moral choices.', 'External influence compromises autonomy and freedom.', 'Moral agency demands conscious, deliberate choices.', 'Nudges can create moral strain and distress.', 'Reduced self-reflection hinders moral reasoning.', 'Pre-programmed choices limit personal responsibility.', 'Subconscious influence bypasses moral evaluation.', 'Nudges weaken belief in free will, increasing cheating.', 'Moral disengagement justifies inhumane actions.', 'Self-regulation is bypassed, reducing moral agency.', 'Nudges shift responsibility from individual to architect.', 'Compliance to authority diminishes moral agency.', 'Default options limit conscious decision-making.']";['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital'];['support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support'];0.8666666666666667

Global warming leads to an increase in temperature of oceans, which in turn leads to more and stronger hurricanes and tropical storms since hurricanes get their energy from the seawater. Moreover, the probability of droughts increases since the planet’s average temperature increases. It is quite difficult to prove the causal connection between climate change and natural disasters since there are many other variables, but the increase of natural disasters over the last decades likely leads to the conclusion that global warming is a major contributor to natural disasters. Natural activities in the earth’ crust\nNatural disasters are also caused by natural activities in the crust of the earth.', 'So I also asked myself what factors made 2011 seem so rife with disasters. Electronics technology – and social media – surely both play into it. With electronics such as smartphones and iPads – and social media such as Twitter and Facebook – information can be shared almost instantly when disasters strike. Just like many people I know, I typically get my news from Twitter before any other news source. In today’s age, when something bad happens, we hear about it sooner. Random sources (your friends, or friends of friends) will update their statuses on social media websites. People retweet those statuses, and before you know it, millions of people have read about some disaster before traditional media has had time to publish the news. Also, urban sprawl is increasing. Both large and small cities are growing in size and population. With more people in the world, disasters can actually increase the number of casualties and injuries that take place.'];The passage explains that our use of electronics does not directly cause natural disasters, but it does make us more vulnerable to the effects of certain types of space-related natural disasters like solar storms. Solar storms produce magnetic shock waves and radiation that can severely damage electronic systems and power grids. This damage includes shorting out satellites, disrupting power supplies, and increasing the breakage of fuel and gas pipelines, among other effects. Our dependency on electronic devices and complex power systems increases the potential impact of these disruptions, thereby heightening our vulnerability during such events.

In both cases, culture cannot be optimized until all students are participating in discussions and sharing their voices. If some students feel silenced, then they will not contribute and miss out on valuable learning experiences. When certain students feel uncomfortable speaking, class can become stale and boring, since teachers and students know that only a few voices will do all the talking. When all students’ voices are consistently heard in the classroom, then teachers have the chance to push students in their speaking abilities, even using tools like cold calling to maximize participation and formatively assess the class. Seventeen-year veteran teacher Stacey Ryan acknowledges the connection between hearing every voice and assessing student abilities in her piece, “3 Tech Tools that Inspire Collaboration.” She writes, “By capturing students’ learning in a small-group setting and without the teacher at their side, I am able to hear my students think aloud and readily verbalize what they know.” Stacey uses small au dio devices offered by Lightspeed, which allow her to listen in on students’ small-group discussions. Effective communication is a theme in my next point, too: Create a Clear Communication Line With Parents\nIt’s easy to fall into the day-to-day rhythm of the school year and forget that students have lives outside of the hours we spend with them each week.', ""Increased Academic Understanding\nStudents who listen in class gain a better understanding of the content the teacher presents and can identify the fundamental concepts. Their concentration ultimately results in storage of information in memory. This helps the student when he needs to recall and build upon prior knowledge, especially in a subject such as math, which is based upon previous skill attainment. Good listeners are better equipped to connect to new ideas and content. Enhanced Interpersonal Connections\nWhether a student is part of a teacher's or a guest speaker's audience, he needs to earn that person's respect and confidence. When the student is attentive, the speaker feels valued and is subsequently more open to the student's suggestions and input. Teachers react favorably when their pupils make an effort to actively listen in class. Students also have a high regard for peers who listen intently to their comments and questions. Sharpened Listening Skills\nTeachers typically incorporate listening prompts and activities throughout the day. They use rhythm games with young students to teach them aggressive listening skills."", ""Ensure that everyone's contributions are audible. In a large classroom, or even a small one with poor acoustics, it might be difficult for a student making a verbal contribution to be heard by a classmate on the other side of the room. This can detract significantly from the class dynamics, as students will become frustrated or cease to pay attention if they can't hear what is being shared. Frequently, students will need to be encouraged to speak loudly and clearly. Try reminding them that they should be addressing their comments not to you, who might happen to be standing close by, but to the classmate who is sitting farthest away. When a quiet student starts to speak, it's often helpful to resist your natural inclination to move closer, and instead to move to the other side of the room, so that the student is encouraged to speak more loudly. In some cases, you may need to reiterate a student's contribution, to ensure that everyone hears it. Consider the use of an online poll before the class discussion. Students may be more willing to participate in debates and discussions if they can see that other students share their views. The results from a pre-class anonymous poll can be presented to students as a starting point or to set the stage for their in-class discussion."", 'Without this standard in the classroom, it is only natural that the most outspoken voices will try to lead the conversation while quieter voices fall behind, when often it’s the quieter voices that most need to be heard in discussions of equity. Listening\nAttwood believes that students who are able to listen and process others’ perspectives without feeling the need to jump in and defend their own views can learn the most in an equitable environment. Setting Personal Teaching Standards\nAlongside setting standards for how the students in his or her classroom should act, a teacher must also take the time to address and live out their own personal teaching standards. Educators set these standards by communicating personal traits like openness, fairness, and approachability so that students who do partake in these often difficult equity-related discussions feel comfortable doing so. Attwood explains that it’s important she can “communicate being approachable and willing to listen to some students who are feeling that something’s not working in that climate of the classroom.” This, she stresses, is a key factor in creating the open dialogue needed to address these delicate issues. 3. Setting the Tone for Learning\nWhereas setting classroom standards is about developing how students will react and engage with discussions in the classroom, setting the tone for learning is about starting students off with activities, exercises, readings, and discussion questions that bridge these difficult topics right from the start. “I often do exercises at the beginning of a class to present an opportunity [for students] to explore for themselves—then share with each other—who they are and the backgrounds that they bring. I share mine [too],” Attwood says. “', 'Seventeen-year veteran teacher Stacey Ryan acknowledges the connection between hearing every voice and assessing student abilities in her piece, “3 Tech Tools that Inspire Collaboration.” She writes, “By capturing students’ learning in a small-group setting and without the teacher at their side, I am able to hear my students think aloud and readily verbalize what they know.” Stacey uses small au dio devices offered by Lightspeed, which allow her to listen in on students’ small-group discussions. Effective communication is a theme in my next point, too: Create a Clear Communication Line With Parents\nIt’s easy to fall into the day-to-day rhythm of the school year and forget that students have lives outside of the hours we spend with them each week. Opening up a solid line of communication with parents allows teachers to see a fuller picture of students’ personalities and behavior in the classroom. It can help to prevent issues before they ever arise, and it can help teachers feel more comfortable bringing other stakeholders, like counselors and administrators, into conversations when more help is needed. The idea of opening up lines of communication with parents probably brings to mind the dreaded “phone call home” that teachers make when a student is misbehaving or under-performing. Of course, teachers still need to address students’ challenges with parents, but now there are many options available to encourage a more positive cycle of conversation between parents and teachers. Many schools are adopting tools like Bloomz to help facilitate rich dialogue between schools and home.']";Privilege in the classroom context often relates to which students feel comfortable and are encouraged to contribute to discussions. When certain students possess social, cultural, or economic advantages, they might be more likely to participate actively, feeling confident and secure in expressing their viewpoints. Conversely, students who do not feel this sense of privilege may be less likely to speak up, feeling that their voices are not valued or heard, thereby missing out on important learning opportunities and contributing to a less inclusive classroom environment. This dynamic showcases the need for teachers to foster an equitable classroom where all voices are equally heard and valued, regardless of underlying privilege.;['Privilege impacts who is heard in class', 'Unearned advantage affects classroom participation', 'Teacher bias favors privileged students’ voices', 'Socioeconomic status limits student voice', 'Race/identity shapes classroom hearing', 'Systemic inequities silence marginalized voices', 'Inclusive classrooms amplify all voices', 'Culturally responsive teaching is crucial', 'Addressing privilege fosters classroom equity', 'Open dialogue promotes student participation', 'Positive classroom climate is key for equity', 'Student voice is essential for classroom equity', 'Active listening is crucial for equitable hearing', 'Power imbalances affect who’s heard in class', 'Teacher-student relationships matter for inclusion', 'Classroom culture shapes inclusion and equity', 'Privilege manifests differently in the classroom', 'Paying attention reveals privilege in the classroom', 'Privilege allows dominance in classroom discourse', 'Self-awareness mitigates impact of privilege', 'Students’ behavior communicates privilege and inequity', 'Active listening corrects misunderstandings and biases', 'Teacher awareness of bias is crucial for equity', 'Authentic dialogue is key for equitable participation', 'Equity means more than equal numbers of voices', 'Subtle gender biases affect classroom hearing', 'Privilege impacts who is heard and understood', 'Cultural capital influences classroom participation', 'Dominant culture values rewarded in education'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital'];['support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'support'];0.7142857142857143

This debate centers on public schools; very few people are arguing that religious doctrine cannot be taught at private schools or that teachers at such schools cannot lead students in prayer. And even in public institutions, there is little debate about the right of individual students, teachers and other school employees to practice their religion – by, say, praying before lunch or wearing religious clothing or symbols. Moreover, as a 2019 survey of American teens shows some forms of religious expression are relatively common in public schools. For instance, about four-in-ten public school students say they routinely see other students praying before sporting events, according to the survey. And about half of U.S. teens in public schools (53%) say they often or sometimes see other students wearing jewelry or clothing with religious symbols. About this report\nThis analysis, updated on Oct. 3, 2019, was originally published in 2007 as part of a larger series that explored different aspects of the complex and fluid relationship between government and religion. This report includes sections on school prayer, the pledge of allegiance, religion in school curricula, and the religious liberty rights of students and teachers. The report does not address questions of government funding for religious schools (that is, school vouchers and tax credits) because the schools in question are largely private, not public.', 'The separation of church and state ensures that: Public schools can teach, but not preach, about religion. Public schools may instruct students about religion in an even-handed, objective manner, such as discussing the impact of religion on history, art, music and literature, or teaching a course on comparative religion. But they may not teach religiously based curriculum. Sound science and history is taught in public schools. Public schools may not teach religious doctrine, like creationism and intelligent design, in science class, nor may they disparage proven scientific theories like evolution because some believe it conflicts with their religion. Further, public schools may not teach inaccurate versions of American history that are based on religious teachings. Students feel like part of their school community. They aren’t singled out or excluded because they have different religious beliefs— or none. School assemblies with religious content and coaches who lead prayers in the locker room, for example, alienate students who belong to minority religions or are nontheists, and discourage many students from fully participating in school life.', ""Although the U.S. Supreme Court has consistently rejected efforts to teach religion in the public schools, it has permitted teaching about religion in the context of a public education. What constitutes teaching about religion? Teaching about religion must be clearly distinguished from teaching religion, which amounts to religious indoctrination and practice and is clearly prohibited in public schools. A program intended to teach religion, disguised as teaching about religion, will be found unconstitutional. Religion may be presented as part of a public educational program, with the goal of teaching students about the role of religion in the historical, cultural, economic and social development of the United Stated and other nations, and instilling understanding, tolerance and respect. Religion must be discussed in a neutral, objective, balanced and factual manner. The curriculum's approach may not be devotional or doctrinal, nor have the effect of promoting or inhibiting religion. How may the study of religion be integrated into the public school curriculum? The study of religion may naturally occur within the context of studying other topics. In early education, the subject of religion may naturally arise in discussion of families, communities, and different cultures and holidays."", ""Religion in Public Schools | Lawyers.com\nResearch\nEducation Law\nReligion in Public Schools\nPublic schools may not promote religion, but they must allow students to practice their faith. Learn how the both sides of religious liberty affect prayers at school, students' expression of their faith, religious holiday displays, and more. By E.A. Gjelten, Legal Editor\nUpdated: Feb 5th, 2019\nFreedom of religion, guaranteed under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, has two parts: Government may not either promote religion (the “establishment clause”) or prevent people from practicing their religion (the “free-exercise clause”). The U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized that the First Amendment applies to state and local governments—including public schools. But that hasn’t settled the debates about teaching and practicing religion in school. Controversies—whether about prayers at school, teaching religion, religious holiday displays, or students sharing their faith—usually involve a conflict between the free-exercise clause and the establishment clause. Teachers and school officials have to strike a balance between two requirements: making sure the school doesn’t appear to promote one religion over another or sponsor religious expression, and\nallowing students to practice their religion, which includes praying and expressing their faith—in class, in homework, in commencement speeches, and to classmates."", 'Although it is legal to teach about religion in public schools in a neutral and secular manner, school administrators, teachers and parents should be cognizant of the inherent dangers of bringing religion into the classroom. 10 Public school teachers should carefully consider the following factors: Students are extremely susceptible to peer and public pressure and coercion. This concern is heightened, of course, at the elementary school level. Any discussion of religion in the classroom should be sensitive to the beliefs of the different students in the class. No student should be made to feel that his or her personal beliefs or practices are being questioned, infringed upon or compromised. A student should never feel ostracized on the basis of his or her religious beliefs. If religion is discussed, great care must be taken to discuss minority as well as majority religions. The inclusion of only the major religions in a classroom discussion does not reflect the actual religious diversity within our society and the world. Cursory discussions will subtly denigrate the validity of minority religious beliefs held by some individuals, regardless of whether adherents to minority beliefs are represented in the class.']";Religion manifests in public schools mainly through individual expressions of faith, rather than state-sponsored activities, due to the First Amendment's establishment clause. Examples of such personal expressions include students praying before meals or sporting events, or wearing jewelry and clothing with religious symbols.

Each social situation entails its own particular set of expectations about the “proper” way to behave. Such expectations can vary from group to group. One way in which these expectations become apparent is when we look at the roles that people play in society. Social roles are the part people play as members of a social group. With each social role you adopt, your behavior changes to fit the expectations both you and others have of that role.

Evolutionary psychology is relatively rare and evolutionary psychologists typically teach related subjects like cognitive or developmental psychology. Evolutionary psychologists may also teach subjects like anthropology, primate behavior, and comparative psychology.', 'Societal influence: The structure of society often forms individuals into certain roles based on the social situations they choose to experience. Parents enrolling their children in certain programs at a young age increases the chance that the child will follow that role. Genetic predisposition: People take on roles that come naturally to them. Those with athletic ability generally take on roles of athletes. Those with mental genius often take on roles devoted to education and knowledge. This does not mean that people must choose only one path, each individual can reprise multiple roles (i.e. Evelyn can be the point guard on the basketball team and the editor of her school newspaper). Cultural influence: Different cultures place different values on certain roles based on their lifestyle.', 'Why Is Evolutionary Psychology Important?

Biology, evolutionary biology, sociology, economics, psychology, and anthropology all lend strands to SRV. Even history and geography have ideas to contribute. Although SRV is not in itself a science, it is based on empirically produced disciplines. Science in psychology, special education and philosophy\nPsychology and philosophy tell us that there is considerable doubt about the common sense idea that we have total free will; what we do is often societally or physically caused by unconscious mechanisms. Science tells us that people do not often act as completely free-thinking individuals, but in fact occupy particular social strata and roles that organize and simplify their social communication.']";Evolutionary psychology suggests that societal roles are influenced by both genetic predispositions and the evolutionary challenges our ancestors faced, which have shaped our behavioral inclinations. The roles individuals adopt within society, such as caregivers, leaders, or mates, often stem from evolutionary adaptations that increased survival and reproductive success in ancient environments.

Rather he wished to hold the Union together. As the War continued, Lincoln became convinced of the necessity of issuing an Emancipation Proclamation but believed that he needed a military success to give the Proclamation force and credibility. The victory at Antietam, narrow as it was, and tremendous as was its human cost, gave him that opportunity. Emancipation was indeed a new birth of freedom. It also, as Professor McPherson points out, changed the character of the War from one with the aim of trying to persuade the South to come back to a state of total War -- which changed the character of a culture and redefined the nature of freedom in the United States. Professor McPherson\'s book is part of a series called ""Pivotal Moments in American History"" whose aim is ""to encourage interest in problems of historical contingency."" There was a great deal of chance involved in the Battle of Antietam, more so than in most military campaigns. ( There were also military blunders on both sides.) During the course of the southern invasion the Union discovered by chance a copy of General Lee\'s ""Special Order No.', 'It gave the Union the courage, will and political force to fight on. Second, Professor McPherson emphasizes the role of the European powers -- England and France -- in the Civil War. These nations followed events in America closely and were economically at risk from the loss of Southern cotton for their textile mills. They likely would have recognized the Confederacy if the results of the first invasion of the North had favored the Confederacy. Third, and probably most importantly to his theme, Professor McPherson discusses the role of Antietam in the changing character of the Civil War. President Lincoln was opposed to slavery, but his initial war aims did not include freeing the slaves. Rather he wished to hold the Union together.

Emancipation was indeed a new birth of freedom.']";The transformation of the Civil War into a war for freedom primarily resulted from a shift in the Union's objectives as the conflict progressed. Initially, the North fought primarily for the reunification of the states, with relatively limited political aims primarily centered around maintaining the Union. However, over time, the war's focus expanded to include the abolition of slavery, particularly following key military victories such as Antietam, which provided President Lincoln with the political momentum required to issue the Emancipation Proclamation. This pivotal shift redefined the war as not only a battle for the preservation of the Union but also a decisive fight for human freedom and the end of slavery, marking a profound change in the nation's character and values.;['Emancipation Proclamation redefined war aims', 'War evolved into a fight for freedom and against slavery', 'Abolition became a key Union objective', 'Four million enslaved people gained freedom', '200,000 Black soldiers fought for the Union', 'Initially, Union fought for reunification', 'Confederacy fought for independence and slavery', 'Lincoln framed emancipation as military necessity', 'Emancipation fundamentally changed the war', 'Southern economy relied on enslaved labor', 'Slaves played a key role in their own liberation', 'The war ended slavery in the United States', '13th Amendment abolished slavery', 'Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address emphasized freedom', 'The war redefined American freedom', 'Post-war Reconstruction aimed at racial equality', 'Total war strategy adopted by the North', 'European powers withdrew support from Confederacy', 'Union gained crucial military advantage', 'Juneteenth commemorates end of slavery in Texas'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support'];0.7

For instance, ambient concentrations of benzene tend to be greatest near major sources (e.g., oil refineries, chemical production facilities) and in high-traffic areas. Air pollution can also be regional or national in nature. For example, emissions sources hundreds of miles away can contribute to airborne fine particulate matter at a given location. 3\nA few air pollution issues are global in nature, such as intercontinental transport of particles during dust storms. Stratospheric ozone depletion, also, is affected by releases of ozone-depleting substances from countries worldwide.

Advancements in technology and science have helped humans alter their geographic environment by the construction of homes, cities, and associated amenities such as communication and channels. Manmade Environment\nThe manmade environment is created by man to monitor and regulate his living conditions. It can be divided into outer and inner environments.

During the recycling process in the informal sector, toxic chemicals that have no economic value are simply dumped. The toxic industrial effluent is poured into underground aquifers and seriously affects the local groundwater quality, thereby making the water unfit for human consumption or for agricultural purposes. Atmospheric pollution is caused by dismantling activities as dust particles loaded with heavy metals and flame retardants enter the atmosphere. These particles either redeposit (wet or dry deposition) near the emission source or, depending on their size, can be transported over long distances. The dust can also enter the soil or water systems and, with compounds found in wet and dry depositions, can leach into the ground and cause both soil and water pollution. Soils become toxic when substances such as lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are deposited in landfills. Classification\nE-waste can be classified on the basis of its composition and components. Ferrous and nonferrous metals, glass, plastics, pollutants, and other are the six categories of materials reported for e-waste composition. Iron and steel constitute the major fraction in waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) materials, with plastics being the second largest.', '2\nDeveloping countries with rapidly growing economies handle e-waste from developed countries, and from their own internal consumers. Currently, an estimated 70 percent of e-waste handled in India is from other nations, but the UNEP estimates that between 2007 and 2020, domestic television e-waste will double, computer e-waste will increase five times, and cell phones 18 times. The informal sector’s recycling practices magnify health risks. For example, primary and secondary exposure to toxic metals, such as lead, results mainly from open-air burning used to retrieve valuable components such as gold. Combustion from burning e-waste creates fine particulate matter, which is linked to pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. While the health implications of e-waste are difficult to isolate due to the informal working conditions, poverty, and poor sanitation, several studies in Guiyu, a city in southeastern China, offer insight. Guiyu is known as the largest e-waste recycling site in the world, and the city’s residents exhibit substantial digestive, neurological, respiratory, and bone problems. For example, 80 percent of Guiyu’s children experience respiratory ailments, and are especially at risk of lead poisoning. 3\nResidents of Guiyu are not the only ones at risk. Researchers such as Brett Robinson, a professor of soil and physical sciences at Lincoln University in New Zealand, warn that wind patterns in Southeast China disperse toxic particles released by open-air burning across the Pearl River Delta Region, home to 45 million people.', 'Subscribe Now\nEnvironmental impacts\nAlthough electronics constitute an indispensable part of everyday life, their hazardous effects on the environment cannot be overlooked or underestimated. The interface between electrical and electronic equipment and the environment takes place during the manufacturing, reprocessing, and disposal of these products. The emission of fumes, gases, and particulate matter into the air, the discharge of liquid waste into water and drainage systems, and the disposal of hazardous wastes contribute to environmental degradation. In addition to tighter regulation of e-waste recycling and disposal, there is a need for policies that extend the responsibility of all stakeholders, particularly the producers, beyond the point of sale and up to the end of product life. There are a number of specific ways in which e-waste recycling can be damaging to the environment. Burning to recover metal from wires and cables leads to emissions of brominated and chlorinated dioxins, causing air pollution. During the recycling process in the informal sector, toxic chemicals that have no economic value are simply dumped. The toxic industrial effluent is poured into underground aquifers and seriously affects the local groundwater quality, thereby making the water unfit for human consumption or for agricultural purposes. Atmospheric pollution is caused by dismantling activities as dust particles loaded with heavy metals and flame retardants enter the atmosphere. These particles either redeposit (wet or dry deposition) near the emission source or, depending on their size, can be transported over long distances.', 'A study done by the watchdog group Basel Action Network using trackers, however, found that 40 percent of the e-waste supposedly recycled in the U.S. was actually exported. Most of it ended up in developing countries—usually in Asia—where informal recycling is typically unlicensed and unregulated. At these informal recycling workshops, men, women and children recover valuable materials by burning devices to melt away non-valuable materials, using mercury and acids to recover gold, and dismantling devices by hand to reclaim other materials of value. Collecting wires which will later be burned in Guiyu, China. Photo: baselactionnetwork\nUsually they do not wear protective equipment and lack any awareness that they are handling dangerous materials. Research has found that inhaling toxic chemicals and direct contact with hazardous e-waste materials (even in some formal e-waste recycling settings) result in increases in spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, premature births, reduced birth weights, mutations, congenital malformations, abnormal thyroid function, increased lead levels in blood, decreased lung function, and neurobehavioral disturbances. Moreover, e-waste toxins contaminate the air, soil and groundwater. In the face of these health and environmental hazards, however, many people in developing countries earn a living by dismantling, refurbishing, repairing and reselling used electronic devices. Guiyu, China is often considered the e-waste capital of the world, with 75 percent of households involved in the recycling business.', 'Due to the unregulated nature of the informal recycling sector in developing countries, US e-waste handlers could be exporting threats to human and environmental health. Hazardous materials in electronic devices\nElectronic devices are combinations of hundreds of different types of materials; many of them are considered to be toxic when exposed to humans. Although present within the device, these toxic heavy metals have only been documented to become a health hazard once the device is broken down. The process of electrical device breakdown occurs in a variety of locations and settings (recycling sites, storage locations), yet becomes a prominent health hazard when broken down in domestic or international sites that do not have the correct equipment or recycling methods. When taken apart without proper recycling methods, tools, or protective wear, workers and residents become exposed to the toxic chemicals in the devices. E-waste negatively impacts health primarily through the exposure of heavy metal dioxins. Incinerating e-waste without proper workplace and environmental regulations poses a risk because it generates dioxins, which can cause cancer and plague the human body and environment for long periods of time. Moreover, open burning, a common practice in developing countries receiving e-waste, releases toxic fumes and dust that can be easily inhaled and effect nearby food sources and water bodies. In addition to direct exposure through open burning and dismantling, e-waste storages and landfills can result in leakage of dioxins into the natural surroundings area.']";The informal recycling sector contributes to air pollution through the practice of burning e-waste primarily to recover valuable metals from materials such as wires and cables. This process releases harmful substances, including brominated and chlorinated dioxins, into the atmosphere, which are known contributors to air pollution. The atmospheric pollution is further exacerbated by the dispersion of dust particles loaded with heavy metals and flame retardants, which are released during the dismantling activities associated with e-waste recycling. These particles can travel long distances or redeposit near the source, continuing to affect air quality and overall environmental health.;['Informal recycling often involves open burning.', 'Burning e-waste releases toxic air pollutants.', 'E-waste burning releases heavy metals (lead, cadmium).', 'Dioxins and furans are released by burning e-waste.', 'Burning releases particulate matter and soot.', 'Plastic in e-waste produces harmful hydrocarbons.', 'Toxic fumes from burning cause respiratory problems.', 'Informal sectors lack pollution control technology.'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay'];['support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.6666666666666666

The NEA is incorporated as a professional association in a few states and as a Trade union in most. The group holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code. It is not a member of the AFL–CIO, but is part of Education International, the global federation of teachers' unions. NEA members set the union's policies through the Representative Assembly (RA). The RA, which is a delegation comprising elected representatives from each local and state affiliate, coalitions of student members and retired members, and other segments of the united education profession—is the primary legislative and policy-making body of the NEA. As of 2020\n[update]\n, the executive officers of the NEA are Rebecca Pringle (President), Princess Moss (Vice President), Noel Candelaria (Secretary-Treasurer) and Kim A. Anderson (Executive Director)."", ""One of the most prominent education lobbying group in the nation, the NEA is influential in politics – ranging from school board elections to the presidential election. With 2.6 million members in America's schools, one in one hundred Americans is an NEA member. This makes NEA a loud voice in America's public-education policy debate. NEA's lobbying efforts are based on the initiatives passed by the Representative Assembly, and usually involve school funding issues, student testing requirements, and federal funding for needy schools. The NEA has a political action committee (PAC) named the Fund for Children and Public Education, which is used to contribute funds to candidates running for office who uphold the principles of the NEA and its affiliates. Members donate to the PAC, but it is not funded through dues assessments like many other labor union PACs. Communications.

The decision highlighted how legislation relating to the NEA can lead to Supreme Court interpretations that potentially affect the broader application of First Amendment rights and the discourse around federally funded arts.

It makes sense that equality would have been the focus over the past four decades given the Supreme Court’s establishment of the Rowley standard of 1982, which enshrined the term ‘de minimis’ education in reference to what was required from school districts serving students with disabilities. In Rowley the Court ruled that the law’s intent was not to enable students with disabilities to achieve their full potentials, but rather to give them equal and sufficient access to a free and appropriate public education (FAPE). Ever since this decision, too many schools simply complied with paperwork requirements and provided cookie-cutter services which were anything but truly individualized. The presence alone of a disability did not mandate special education services. However, the very nature of special education is that no child is starting from the same place. With the Supreme Court’s unanimous 8-0, Endrew F. decision (2017) on the books and a new standard established which requires schools to demonstrate ‘meaningful progress’ and ‘appropriately ambitious’ goals for students with disabilities, it is time we move from focusing on equality to truly one of ensuring equity.

The principal is one of the key culture determinants in the school environment and can communicate volumes to the school community by demonstrating an active interest in special education. Principals play an enormous role in the authorization of resources and supports in the public school environment and need to exercise their full authority to ensure every child receives every resource necessary to truly be successful and grow. Although IEP meetings are comprised of many members, the principal always retains a special role of significance and has a unique ability to impact the education of each child in the building.

An outline of what lectures are going to be about can still be useful for organizing your thoughts, but can also be woven into the presentation materials for the class. Overhead transparencies are replaced with common forms of digital media (e.g., photos, audio recordings, PowerPoint presentations, movie clips, even actions on your own monitor ), which are much more portable and don’t require specialized materials. Additional information that’s not embedded in original course material can easily be distributed as e-mail attachments or linked to from within the coursework, and it’s up to each student to decide if printing to paper is even necessary. A good learning management system (LMS) will include a method for embedding quizzes into the online course materials, which should include a system for grading materials and notifying student of grades. In the case of many training programs, certification is the goal, which can also easily be managed through the same interface as the course.

However, such a shock might not impact European prices in the same way as it did in Northeast Asia because we are entering a ‘buyers’ market’. Indeed, the demand in Asia is lower than anticipated and developments in liquefied natural gas (LNG) capacities globally favour gas consumers.

And there are few options (and little time) for Europe to secure gas flows to its citizens this coming winter other than doing its homework – preparing for the worst this coming winter – and to continue supporting Ukraine in securing finances for filling up its storage capacity. Strained relationships between the EU and Russia due to the Ukrainian crisis have forced Gazprom – Russia’s state gas monopolist – to abandon the idea of controlling pipelines from ‘wellhead to burner tip’. Gazprom’s new grand vision in Europe is to build pipelines to the EU border and from there its clients are expected to take gas to their home markets. As part of this vision, it also commits not to use Ukrainian pipelines after 2019. So if Europeans need Russian gas they should build the missing links connecting to Gazprom’s proposed pipelines – the Turkish Stream and the recently-announced expansion of the Nord Stream link – themselves, or so goes the current thinking in Gazprom and the Kremlin. However, neither Turkish nor Western companies are rushing to build these pipelines.

But, the recent slump in oil prices means that some of the LNG production capacities may never materialise, while the low price environment would also encourage more gas demand. Thus, markets are self-correcting the imbalances and eliminating the potential surplus. What could really constrain the long-term upward pressure on prices, should such a supply shock materialise and persist, is Europe’s willingness to pay for gas, which is relatively low. This is perhaps thanks to German, Spanish and Italian taxpayers who contributed to financing renewables, making electricity markets in Europe not only ‘greener’ but also to strategically counterbalance the market power of gas suppliers such as Russia or Qatar. Still, a price increase in relative terms could be rather sharp in the short-term, should we witness the removal of Russian gas volumes through Ukraine. Even if the commercial side of the transit question is resolved, a ‘transit–avoidance’ policy is deeply rooted in the minds of Gazprom’s masters in Kremlin\nThus, the desired positive development is some sort of reconciliation between Russia and Ukraine, possibly through the containment of the conflict in the Donbas.', ""In 2017, Germany, France, Austria and European Commission criticized the United States over new sanctions against Russia that target Nord Stream 2. The United States has been encouraging European countries to diversify Russian-dominated energy supplies, with Qatar as possible alternative supplier. The goal of the Southern Gas Corridor, which connects the giant Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan to Europe, is to reduce Europe's dependency on Russian gas. To compare with alternative sources, Germany produced 10.5% of its electricity from fossil natural gas in 2019 and 8.6% (44 TWh) from renewable biomass, largely biogas. As only 13% of Germany's gas use was for power production, this replaced just above 1 percent of its overall gas consumption. Replacing natural gas with gas produced with Renewable energy in Power-to-gas processes or by direct use of power has more potential for further expansion. Power-to-gas is as yet limited to small-scale demonstration projects, as the carbon dioxide resulting from the combustion of natural gas can be emitted cheaply or for free, and Russia does not take back carbon dioxide from the combustion of Russian gas for underground storage in its depleted gas reservoirs.

News Today, Gone Tomorrow\nTraditional news media may stay on a major news story for weeks or months. Stories that grab attention on social media may do so within hours of their first appearance on the blogosphere, and be gone just as quickly. The PEJ study found that only 13 percent of top stories on blogs in one week were still grabbing attention the next week. That was only true of 5 percent of stories shared on Twitter. If a business is involved in a major story, good or bad, it will have to effectively communicate with traditional news media to have any influence on the story’s outcome.

John Timpane wrote in the Philadelphia Inquirer that a story in Rolling Stone about inappropriate remarks by Gen. Stanley McChrystal erupted into a “media firestorm” in June 2010 due mainly to Twitter, Web reports and cable news that in two days abruptly ended the general’s post as commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan–before the story ever appeared in Rolling Stone. Chasing Social Media\nWhen a news item reaches a sudden flash point, reporters are often chasing bloggers to catch up with stories that are suddenly widely known without credible sources. Columnist Mitch Albom of the Detroit Free Press wrote ""there is no such thing as a single ‘media’ anymore.', ""But unless the article includes an announcement of new jobs, the story’s influence may be minimal. Social media follows a different lead. The PEJ study found stories covered by bloggers were ones that elicited emotion, concerned rights of individuals or groups, or raised vigorous debate. Bloggers push hot buttons of public reaction. Yet despite the difference in coverage, 99 percent of the stories' bloggers link to are from newspapers and broadcast networks. Business stories that appear in traditional mass media outlets may not have as much direct influence on people as in the past, but they do influence bloggers. News Today, Gone Tomorrow\nTraditional news media may stay on a major news story for weeks or months. Stories that grab attention on social media may do so within hours of their first appearance on the blogosphere, and be gone just as quickly. The PEJ study found that only 13 percent of top stories on blogs in one week were still grabbing attention the next week. That was only true of 5 percent of stories shared on Twitter."", '1\nThis gap between short- and long-form content in engaged time remains consistent across time of day and the pathway taken to get to the news story. However, when looking solely within either short- or long-form content, engaged time varies significantly depending on how the reader got to the article, whether it is midday or evening, and even what topic the article covers, according to the study. While 123 seconds – or just over two minutes – may not seem long, and a far cry from the idealized vision of citizens settling in with the morning newspaper, two minutes is far longer than most local television news stories today. And that print newspaper over which people linger contains many separate stories, not just one. In addition, our analysis indicates that this metric almost certainly underestimates the real time spent reading or watching a news story. Specifically, the Parse.ly metrics capture screen movements such as scrolling or clicking, within 5.5 second intervals. While more precise counts of actual user engaged time may still be out of reach with existing methods, what is of most value is the relative difference that emerges between long- and short-form stories. And here the conclusion across this dataset is consistent: People are spending more time on longer stories than on shorter ones, suggesting that engagement can expand to meet the demands of a more in-depth piece. The data also reveal that while shorter news content is far more prevalent than long-form and thus draws more total traffic, long-form articles are accessed at nearly the same rate.', 'The family were asleep at the time. The flames quickly spread and soon the entire house was blazing. etc etc\nThe reader knows the outcome of the drama in the first sentence of the news story. The background information about how it happened, and why it happened, are filled in later in the story. ^^back to the top\nTop priority\nNews stories are written in a way which sets out clearly what is the top priority news, what is the next most newsworthy, and so on. This makes it easier for readers and listeners to understand. In many societies, people read newspapers and web pages in a hurry. They probably do not read every word, but skim quickly through, reading headlines and intros to see which stories interest them. Some which seem at first glance to be interesting may seem less interesting after a few paragraphs, and so the reader moves on. In other societies, people may find reading a newspaper hard work.', 'With regard to context, of course we often recall the context of where we heard some news, for a period of time. But normally this form of recollection does not last long: Larson (1992) found that, in his own case, context information for nonemotional news was at chance level after 2 months. Certainly it is not retained for the 30 years recorded in Colgrove’s data. A large number of studies were conducted following the Brown and Kulik article, but these often involved the individual hearing of some public disaster or some good or bad news, having an emotional reaction, and either recalling or misrecalling the relevant context after a relatively short period of time, ranging from 6 months to 3 years, but not decades ( Bohannon, 1988; Christiansen & Engelberg, 1999; Lee & Brown, 2003; Neisser & Harsch, 1992; Schmolck, Buffalo, & Squire, 2000; Wright, 1993 ).']";"According to the provided passage, the longevity and impact of news stories can vary significantly between different media platforms. Traditional news media may cover a major news story for an extended period, often weeks or months, maintaining public engagement over a more extended time. In contrast, social media shows a much quicker pace, with stories capturing attention rapidly within hours but typically fading just as fast; for instance, only 13 percent of top stories on blogs and 5 percent of stories on Twitter manage to hold interest into the following week.

Nast hired the best illustrators and photographers of the day, and they produced covers for the magazine that were consistently sophisticated and occasionally revolutionary. In 1932, for example, Vogue became one of the first magazines to print a colour photo on its cover. In the 1960s the magazine redefined the look of female models, eschewing shapely figures to highlight thin, gender-neutral physiques. Vogue ’s August 1974 cover was the first to picture an African American model. In 1988 Anna Wintour became editor of Vogue and immediately transformed Vogue covers by emphasizing the woman’s body, rather than just her face, as well as by frequently featuring Hollywood actresses as opposed to traditional fashion models, thereby sparking an international trend. Wintour also began Teen Vogue (2003) and Men’s Vogue (2005–08) in the United States. In 2003 she and the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) jointly inaugurated the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, which offered financial support and business mentoring to the “next generation” of American fashion designers. In 2009 the film documentary The September Issue —which chronicled the production of the magazine’s record-breaking 840-page September 2007 issue—was released to critical acclaim.

Wintour\'s influence allowed the magazine to maintain its high circulation, while staff discovered new trends that a broader audience could conceivably afford. For example, the inaugural cover of the magazine under Wintour\'s editorship featured a three-quarter-length photograph of Michaela Bercu, an Israeli model, wearing a bejeweled Christian Lacroix jacket and a pair of jeans, a departure from her predecessors\' tendency to portray a woman\'s face alone; according to The New York Times, this gave ""greater importance to both her clothing and her body"". As fashion editor Grace Coddington wrote in her memoirs, the cover ""endorsed a democratic new high/low attitude to dressing, added some youthful but sophisticated raciness, and garnished it with a dash of confident energy and drive that implied getting somewhere fast. It was quintessential Anna."" Throughout her reign at Vogue, Wintour accomplished her goals to revitalize the magazine and oversaw production of some of its largest editions. The September 2004 edition measured 832 pages, the highest ever for a monthly magazine. Wintour continues to be American Vogue \' s editor-in-chief to this day.

In many regards, process philosophy has impacted the United States government in myriad ways, including its approach to the economy, to the legislature, and to various social and cultural issues. With regards to this dynamic in recent decades, the most profound examples of the application of process philosophy to governmental policy have been in the arenas of marriage and of education. Looking back in history from 2017, it is hard to believe that less than a century ago, most Americans believed that marriage was only possible between a man and a woman, and that higher education was a privilege that should be reserved only for members of the elite classes. In short, the United States’ governmental stance toward marriage, and toward access to education provide the most profound examples of process philosophy in action. Marriage\nIn the United States, the government and society large took it for granted that legal marriage could occur only between a man and a woman, and until recently, the Federal government nor any state governments allowed for the possibility of same-sex marriage under any circumstances. However, when American societal attitudes toward homosexuality began to change in the 1970’s, the possibility of allowing for same-sex marriage began to enter the national dialogue (Hull, 2013). Indeed, such a possibility was vehemently opposed by political conservatives, especially those who were also affiliated with the “Religious Right” (Possamai-Inesedy & Turner, 2016) For such individuals, the purpose of marriage was solely for procreation and the rearing of children, and as such, many conservatives held that same-sex marriage was an affront to nature and to God. However, as the LQBTQ movement gained steam in the 1980’s, 1990’s and 2000’s, many state government s began to reconsider their stances on same-sex marriage.', 'In short, the United States’ governmental stance toward marriage, and toward access to education provide the most profound examples of process philosophy in action.

In the early twentieth century, access to higher education was considered to be the exclusive domain of those who were members of the so-called “leisure classes.” The rationale behind this exclusivity was that the American masses engaged in either manufacturing or agricultural labor, and so did not require extensive schooling in the humanities, the arts, or philosophy. However, with the need for an educated managerial class with the maturing of the Industrial Revolution, it became clear that the doors of higher education should be opened to a wider cross-section of Americans. With the implementation of the G.I. Bill of 1944, which was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in an effort to provide a reward for patriotic young men who had served valiantly in World War II, the United States government began to provide taxpayer funds to pay the college tuition of Americans who could not afford higher education otherwise (Rose, 2016).', 'The Case of Same‐Sex Marriage.

Initially, U.S. government and societal views strictly defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman, primarily for procreation and child-rearing.

The Russian people are told in a hundred ways that they must regard America as a potential enemy, and that the American people are wage slaves of capitalists and dupes of a corrupt culture which by escapist films, jazz and pulp magazines poisons their minds and distracts their attention from the realities of the class struggle, i.e., from their own interest in precipitating a revolution. The recent reincarnation of the Comintern as the ""Cominform"" signalizes the intention of the Soviet leaders to wage this propaganda war without compunction. The truthful information about America reaching the Soviet public today is a trickle compared to this roaring ocean of denunciation and vilification. A promising beginning of an effective information program coördinated with American foreign policy -- the ""Voice of America"" -- aroused keen and favorable interest among Russian listeners, but was curtailed by budget cuts in 1947. It may be said in general that the Soviet public has been conditioned to take radio programs which would seem heavy to many Americans; much of the criticism of the State Department broadcasts to Russia seems to have overlooked this fact. But the underlying objection to the program was, perhaps, the conviction that the United States Government simply should not be active in this field at all. A marked change of tone in the comments of Congressmen recently returned from Europe seems to indicate that this view has been modified under the pressure of events, and that the appropriation for such a program will be increased. This surely is to be desired, and it may be useful for an American lately returned from four years in the U.S.S.R. to try to suggest, a little more in detail, what the attitude of the Russian people toward America and Americans is, as a contribution to the problem of working out an expanded information program.', '28][29]\nRussia was accused by the U.S. authorities for efforts to spread fake news and propaganda in an attempt to meddle in the 2016 US Presidential Election.

There are over 600 ski resorts and 10,000 ski installations in the Alps. France, Switzerland, Austria and Italy provide over 85% of Europe’s skiing area. France has the highest winter season turnover of all these four countries (5,10). 19 % of the area faces increasing economic problems. For 18 % of the area, the economy, settlements and cultural heritage are breaking down as people leave (12). This is particularly the case in southern France, some parts of Italy (e.g. Piemont) and Slovenia. Only tourism can reverse this trend but the number of tourists visiting the Alps has either been constant or decreasing since the 1980s. In these areas forests move into grassland and the area becomes less attractive for tourism (13).

The weather of the past two months--overwhelming snowfalls--has emptied many of the areas\' resorts and will certainly have an effect on tourism. But in a good season, the Alps are the single most popular tourist region in the world, drawing 120 million visitors per year, who spend a full one tenth of the world\'s tourism revenue there. In Austria, tourism is particularly important. It represents more than 6 percent of the country\'s GDP, and pays a higher proportion of local salaries than anywhere else in the world. Resorts in Austria, along with many in Switzerland and France, are under enormous pressure to keep revenues up. That means guaranteeing good skiing. With less snowfall in the lower valleys in recent years, developers have begun building resorts higher and higher up in the mountains, in areas that lack the natural avalanche protection offered by trees. This sort of development worries environmental groups like Greenpeace, which believe that global warming has forced skiers into high-altitude, more avalanche-prone areas. "" Above 1,500 meters, the natural protection from avalanches through forests is limited,"" says Erwin Mayer, a Greenpeace climate expert.

In the 1970s, four-wheel driving enthusiasts discovered the Alps (Johnson 1974). To date, formal tourism superstructure has been kept outside the park. The area is well served by communities located in the foothills of the Alps and by four major Alpine Resort Ski Villages located above the snow line. These villages, surrounded by, but excluded from the ANP, are managed under the development-oriented Alpine Resorts Act (1983). Collectively, they provide in excess of 10,000 beds of commercial and quasicommercial accommodation and attract over 1 million downhill skiers in a good snow year (Alpine Resorts Commission 1993). Recently, the Alpine Resorts Commission (ARC) has begun to promote summer use of the Alps. The management of the Alpine villages has been contentious for many years, as the ARC'S strong development orientation has led it into ongoing conflicts with the conservation movement. Recreation/Tourism Continuum It is widely accepted that tourism in a natural setting is most closely attuned to the leisure and recreation paradigm, with tourism being regarded as an extreme form of recreation (Leiper 1979;"", 'Routes across the Continental Divide at Forest Canyon Pass (Ute Trail, Fall River Road, Trail Ridge Road) and their associated structures (Lake Irene mess hall, for example) provide an exceptional example of transportation and engineering through the years across what would become our nation’s highest continuous paved highway.

Construction of Old Fall River Road between 1913 and 1920, provided tundra access to the new burgeoning tourism industry.

Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Beatrice Willard Alpine Tundra Research Plots represent one of the United States’ first efforts to incorporate science into long-term management. Data collected from these plots continues to influence the experience of visitors today. Today, Trail Ridge Road, scenic viewsheds, and historic alpine trails continue to attract visitors to this unique environment. What is the best way for visitors to explore and experience the tundra? Scenic drives along Trail Ridge Road and Old Fall River Road are a great first step in seeing RMNP’s alpine tundra. Paved pull-offs and formal trails give access to spectacular mountain vistas, opportunities to view wildlife, and a chance to get up close to the short, hardy vegetation that covers the ground.', 'For 18 % of the area, the economy, settlements and cultural heritage are breaking down as people leave (12).

Since the 1980s, the number of tourists visiting the Alps has been either constant or decreasing, which has been detrimental to local economies, especially in regions like southern France, parts of Italy, and Slovenia. These areas have seen a transition where forests are replacing grasslands, diminishing the aesthetic appeal and reducing the attractiveness for tourism.

During this period, which always takes place in late summer, the people of Oceania are encouraged to hate the regime's enemies, such as the rival powers Eastasia and Eurasia. But citizens are also incited to hate internal enemies, those deemed to display subversive, counter-revolutionary tendencies. The hatred generated by Hate Week is appropriately intense—so much so that if a captured enemy soldier happened to make an appearance, he would be torn limb from limb by an enraged populace. Readiness to commit violence is seen as a sign of loyalty to the regime, and so it pays to show the appropriate degree of enthusiasm in this regard. There is method to this apparent madness. The Party has clearly worked out that if people are focused on hating the regime's enemies, they're much less likely to direct their hate toward the Party instead. This is a classic diversionary tactic of authoritarian states, who find it much easier to control people if their anger, bitterness, and hatred are turned away from the state and instead toward objects of hate created by the regime.

These aggressions are caused by the many deprivations and humiliations the inner Party deliberately orchestrates to keep people broken, miserable, and under control. The Two Minutes Hate also functions as a plot device. In a society in which people are kept alienated and apart from each other—and in which too much interaction with others can potentially be a thought crime—this activity brings people together as a group. It gives Winston a chance to observe Julia, even though at first, he doesn't even know her name, and to interact as well with O'Brien, albeit fleetingly. It also shows how the Party uses propaganda to manipulate people.

As one of the first black women in a major television role, Nichols understood the importance of opening doors for minorities and women in entertainment. Nichols continued to push for African-Americans to have more power in film and television. “Until we Blacks and minorities become not only the producers, writers and directors, but the buyers and distributors, we’re not going to change anything,” she told Ebony in 1985. “ Until we become industry, until we control media or at least have enough say, we will always be the chauffeurs and tap dancers.” It’s an issue that, unfortunately, remains relevant today. In February of this year, UCLA’s annual Hollywood Diversity Report found that women and people of color continue to be underrepresented as directors and in studio board rooms. It concluded that “Hollywood studios are leaving money on the table by not developing films and TV shows with more diverse casts.” Fifty years ago, Nichols’s kiss may have broken an important cultural barrier.

Chris Rock attributes his own success to the help of established black actors, such as Eddie Murphy, Keenen Ivory Wayans, and Arsenio Hall, who took “chances” on him.

In an ever more racially diverse world, Hollywood’s ability to include different racial and ethnic groups is pivotal. Industry leaders must take responsibility for diversity problems, and white elites should not hide shortfalls behind a facade of colorblind tolerance. Demographic changes and an ever-expanding international box office will put pressure on Hollywood to diversify, but not necessarily to overhaul longstanding racially relevant barriers — unless more concerted efforts are made.

The software was later implicated in both crashes. “Boeing’s employees chose the path of profit over candor by concealing material information from the F.A.A. concerning the operation of its 737 Max airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception,” David P.

With less than two weeks left in the Trump administration, the agreement takes the question of how a Biden Justice Department would view a settlement off the table. President Trump had repeatedly discussed the importance of Boeing to the economy, even going so far last year to say he favored a bailout for the company. There was never a real threat that prosecutors would have sought a criminal conviction.', 'The plane was 26 years old and was previously in the fleet of Continental Airlines and, later, merger partner United Airlines, according to the website. Boeing has had a bruising couple of years following two crashes of the Boeing 737 Max, which killed 376 people. The plane was grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration and other aviation regulatory authorities in March 2019 and only recently certified to fly again. This week, Boeing settled criminal charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice for defrauding the FAA. ""Boeing’s employees chose the path of profit over candor by concealing material information from the FAA concerning the operation of its 737 Max airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception,"" the DOJ said. Boeing will pay more than $2.5 billion, including a penalty of $243.6 million, compensation payments to 737 Max airline customers of $1.77 billion and a $500 million fund for the victim\'s beneficiaries. The plane in the Sriwijaya crash does not have the software that was at the center of the Max crashes. Boeing added software to the plane\'s flight computer that would work in the background so the Max would feel to pilots like previous versions of the 737. It was called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, and it proved to have serious flaws. In both the crashes, pilots wrestled to keep their aircraft aloft as MCAS repeatedly pushed the nose down.', 'That investigation appeared to have some momentum about a year ago as prosecutors had summoned several Boeing employees in front of a federal grand jury. But the speed of the investigation slowed in the months after the pandemic struck in March. Prosecutors were examining whether a top pilot for the company, Mark Forkner, had intentionally lied to the regulator about the nature of new flight control software. The software, which could push down the nose of the plane, played a role in the two deadly crashes. Lawyers for Mr. Forkner have previously said that he did not mislead regulators and would never put the safety of pilots or passengers at risk. Deferred prosecution agreements are often used by the government in criminal cases against corporations. They effectively hold a prosecution in abeyance, allowing companies to temporarily avoid charges if they don’t commit wrongdoing for a period of time. In Boeing’s case, the charges will be dismissed after three years if Boeing complies with the agreement. The Justice Department did not seek to appoint an independent monitor to oversee Boeing’s compliance — a step the government sometimes takes in such deals — because it said that “the misconduct was neither pervasive across the organization, nor undertaken by a large number of employees.” Wells Fargo agreed to pay $3 billion in a deferred prosecution deal last February stemming from its mistreatment of customers in its community bank.', 'In November 1997 Boeing subsidiary McDonnell Douglas agreed to pay $2 million to settle allegations that it overcharged the Pentagon in a contract to repair aircraft manufacturing equipment. In August 2000 Boeing agreed to pay up to $54 million to resolve two whistleblower lawsuits charging that the company placed defective gears in CH-47D Chinook helicopters and then sold the aircraft to the U.S. Army. In November 2000 Boeing and United Space Alliance agreed to pay a total of $825,000 and give up their rights to $1.2 million in unpaid invoices to settle allegations of overbilling NASA for work overseen between 1986 and 1992 by Rockwell Space Operations (later purchased by Boeing). In July 2003 the U.S. Air Force stripped Boeing of $1 billion in potential revenue as a penalty for obtained documents stolen from its rival Lockheed Martin during a contract competition for military satellites. In November 2003 Boeing dismissed its chief financial officer when it came to light that he had offered a job to an Air Force procurement official while she was in negotiations with the company on a $20 billion contract to supply aerial refueling tankers. Also fired was the former procurement official, Darleen Druyun, who had accepted the job offer. The scandal also led to the resignation of Boeing’s chief executive. In 2004 Druyun was sentenced to nine months in federal prison after admitting that she had lied to prosecutors about approving inflated prices on contracts awarded to Boeing to enhance her job prospects with the company. Boeing’s former chief financial officer also pleaded guilty to a conflict-of-interest charge. In the wake of the Druyun scandal, Congress barred the Pentagon from pursuing the aerial tanker deal with Boeing, and in March 2008 it was awarded to a partnership of Northrop Grumman and Airbus parent EADS.']";Boeing was found to have defrauded the U.S. government by withholding crucial information from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regarding changes to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) software on the 737 Max. This action was part of an effort by Boeing employees to prioritize profit over transparency, leading to a cover-up of their deceit. As a result, Boeing agreed to a legal settlement, paying more than $2.5 billion, including fines and compensation, under a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department, which allowed them to avoid prosecution provided they comply with certain conditions over a three-year period.;['$15 million fine for unlicensed foreign sales', 'Boeing mischarged costs to the government', 'Government contract fraud', 'Criminal conspiracy to defraud the US', 'False claims to government', 'Intent to defraud, false statements', 'Withheld material information from FAA', 'Concealed 737 Max software flaws from FAA', 'Downplayed MCAS significance to regulators', 'Boeing played down MCAS scope', 'Failed to mention MCAS in manuals', 'Pressure to avoid pilot training costs', 'Profit over safety', 'Two fatal 737 Max crashes (346 deaths)', 'MCAS software malfunction', 'Repeated safety lapses, failure to fix', 'Boeing employees’ misconduct', 'Families of victims filed lawsuits', 'Boeing’s response to lawsuits and investigations'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support'];0.7272727272727273

But, BIPOC specifically highlights two groups that have especially suffered in the US and Canada, Black and Indigenous people, due to the long legacy of slavery, genocide, and European colonialism. Advocates for BIPOC also cite the fact that Black and Indigenous people have been the most frequent victims of police violence. The extensive protests in 2020 against the killing of George Floyd by police officers contributed to a significant spike in the use of, interest in, and discourse about BIPOC on social media and Op-Eds. In this context, BIPOC was specifically calling out the fact that police brutality has disproportionately hurt Black Americans.

The Treaty of Versailles had significant negative economic impacts on Germany. Germany was required to pay the Allies $33 billion in reparations for the war damages caused by World War I. These payments made it very difficult for Germany to take actions that would help Germany’s economy grow. Since Germany had to make these payments, they didn’t have as much money to invest in their economy. When the Great Depression occurred in Germany, these payments made it hard for the government of the Weimar Republic to take steps to effectively deal with the Great Depression. Compounding the problems Germany faced with the high reparations was that the Germany government began to print more paper money. This led to out-of-control inflation as prices rose since people had more money to spend, but the supply of goods didn’t increase. This created further problems in Germany, which eventually led to the failure of the Weimar Republic and the rise of the Nazi Party to power.

As in most nations, the economic factors of the time play a significant role in determining how a society will behave. Germany was economically devastated after a draining defeat in World War I.\nDue to the Versailles treaty, Germany was forced to pay incredibly sizeable reparations to France and Great Britain..\nHow did the Treaty of Versailles destroy the German economy? Its “war guilt” article humiliated Germany by forcing it to accept all blame for the war, and it imposed disastrously costly war reparations that destroyed both the post-World War I German economy and the democratic Weimar Republic. The treaty, therefore, ensured the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party. How much money did Germany have to pay because of the Treaty of Versailles? The so-called “guilt clause” of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles placed full blame for the war on Germany and ordered reparations of 132 billion German marks (roughly $400 billion in today’s dollars). The debt fed a cycle of hyperinflation that pushed Germany to the brink of financial collapse. How did reparations affect Germany economy? Reparations ruined Germany’s economy, but when Germany failed to make its January 1923 payment, French troops invaded the Ruhr.', 'The Treaty of Versailles weakened Germany economically, socially, and politically. It left them in financial ruin, humiliated, and caused them greater animosity against allies. Thanks to Article 231, Germany was made to take full responsibility for everything that was destroyed after World War I. Paying for these reparations left the Germany economy in dept. The Treaty of Versailles dictated what compensations had to be paid to the Allies. Germany’s economy was already failing because of the war and now they were made to pay reparations and build their own economy again. Germany had to pay back 6.6 million dollars to the damaged countries, but they could not afford to pay that amount. As a result of them not being able to pay the reparations France and Belgium troops invaded Ruhr and held the people captive. Germany was hopeless in defending these people because of their restricted army. Their army was reduced massively, which was humiliating because they were once a proud nation. They were allowed 100,000 solider, 15,000 navy soldiers, 6 battleships, and no submarines.', 'All of Germany’s power and wealth was given to its enemies in order to make them stronger. With their land loss and import/export restrictions, Germany was unable to join with other nations such as Austria. Germany was helpless and had less land, fewer people, and less power and taxes. Germany’s territorial decision affected Germany’s economy. The loss of the Saar reduced Germany’s industrial strength. The loss of West Prussia took away Germany’s richest farming land, but reparations did the greatest economic damage to Germany. The terms of the Treaty of Versailles were horrendous, and it brought Germany to its knees. Germany could not afford to pay France and Belgium after being brought to their limits during the war and still having to build their own economy. Germany had to pay for all the damage of the war – a sum set at 6.6 million dollars, which were made in instalments until 1984. This ruined Germany’s economy, damaged by the war, and led to the hyperinflation of 1923.', 'Educators go through a rigorous application process, and every answer they submit is reviewed by our in-house editorial team.

One negative impact was Germany had to pay reparations to the Allies. The $33 billion in reparations crippled the German economy leading Germany into a severe economic depression in the 1920s. Another negative impact is that Germany had to accept responsibility for World War I. Germany resented this idea because it was Austria-Hungary that declared war on Serbia, which led to the start of World War I. However, the Allies believed Germany could have prevented the start of World War I by refusing to support Austria-Hungary if Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Germany also lost some land and had its military weakened by the Treaty of Versailles. Germany had to give up some land, including the territory of Alsace-Lorraine, as a result of its defeat in the war. Germany also was allowed to have a military with defensive capabilities only. Germany wasn’t allowed to have a military that could go on the offensive. Germany resented the terms of the Treaty of Versailles.'];Germany was economically disadvantaged by the Treaty of Versailles primarily due to the imposition of heavy war reparations amounting to $33 billion, which drastically hindered economic growth and stability. The financial strain of these reparations contributed to severe hyperinflation, compounding the economic challenges by decreasing the value of the German currency and escalating prices, which destabilized the market. Furthermore, the forced acceptance of war guilt under Article 231 added to the national humiliation and economic burden, amplifying the resentment and hardship among the German populace.;['Massive reparations crippled German economy', 'Reparations led to hyperinflation', 'Loss of industrial resources and territories', 'French occupation of Ruhr disrupted industry', 'Loss of 13% of land, 6 million people', 'Saar and Alsace-Lorraine losses hit steel', 'Reduced industrial capacity and agricultural land', 'Loss of overseas colonies impacted trade', 'Article 231: Sole blame for war damages', 'Forced payments hampered economic growth', 'Import/export restrictions hindered trade', 'High inflation wiped out savings'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital'];['support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support'];0.5

The term ""Latinx"" was designed to include those whose gender identity is fluid or nonbinary.

I think there's also a lot of hurt within the Latinx community, because we don't often see our own stories reflected in the news. So there's a tendency to ask, angrily and with pain, why stories like police shootings of Latinx go unreported. There's a tendency to compare. And I understand that pain, but it sets up a false dichotomy, and it places the onus on forces outside of us. We have yet to harness social media to create a truly widespread, organized group of people with a clear mission statement—which the voices behind Black Lives Matter have done very successfully—possibly because we're such a broad group that it's hard to coalesce around a common goal."", 'In the 1960s, Latinos and Hispanics made their fight for equality even more visible, modeling their actions on the successful African-American struggle for civil rights. In 1962, Cesar Chavez founded the National Farm Workers Association. In 1965, his fledgling organization started a boycott on grape growers that exploited their Latino and Hispanic workers. Latino and Hispanic activists also pushed educational institutions to include the contributions of Latinos and Hispanics in discussions of U.S. History. Throughout the 1960s, Latino-American and Mexican-American history departments opened at many major universities. In 1972, the Latino and Hispanic communities raised formalized their political activism with La Raza Unida Party, based in Corpus Christi Texas. Chapters gradually opened in cities across the country. In 1975, the 1965 Voting Rights Act was extended to the Southwest guaranteeing Latino and Hispanic Americans the equal opportunity to register and vote. Today, Latinos and Hispanics — at 38.8 million counted by the U.S. Census — are the nation’s largest and fastest growing minority. “Non-violence is not inaction.']";In their pursuit of full equality, Latinx Americans have continued to engage actively in movements and employ strategies both old and new. Historically, they have taken cues from African-American civil rights strategies as seen in the 1960s, with Cesar Chavez's significant boycotts against grape growers and the establishment of Latino-oriented political and educational initiatives. In the present-day context, Latinx communities strive to harness the power of social media platforms and create unified, wide-reaching movements, although this effort is challenged by the diverse and broad nature of the community which makes it hard to coalesce around a single, unified agenda. The approach includes standing alongside other marginalized communities, like the Black community, to combat issues such as police brutality, thus strengthening solidarity and broadening their collective protest voice against injustice.;"['Latinx Americans fight for equality via activism and political engagement.', 'Systemic discrimination persists; police brutality and underrepresentation remain issues.', 'The fight against anti-Latinx sentiment, colorism, and xenophobia continues.', 'Collaboration with other marginalized groups builds collective power.', 'Increased political representation at all levels is a key goal.', 'Efforts address systemic inequalities and historical injustices.', 'Combating anti-Blackness and challenging colonial legacies are vital.', 'Improved access to housing and quality education is essential.', 'Advocacy for immigration reform and reproductive justice is ongoing.', 'Fair media representation combats stereotypes.', 'Inclusive policies and removal of systemic barriers are sought.', 'Historical struggles inform current strategies and activism.', 'Economic hardship disproportionately affects Latinx communities.', 'Organizations like LULAC and NALEO promote Latino political participation.', 'Young Latinx use social media for awareness and mobilization.', 'Economic justice addresses wealth and income disparities.', 'Latinx identity encompasses diverse cultural backgrounds.', 'Intersectional approaches address overlapping oppressions.', 'Immigration policies and their impact are central concerns.', 'Latinx women face unique gender and class challenges.', 'Grassroots movements and community organizing are crucial.', 'Landmark cases like Mendez v.

If it covers wider topics, community journalism concentrates on the effect they have on local readers. Community newspapers, often but not always publish weekly, and also tend to cover subjects larger news media do not. Some examples of topics are students on the honor roll at the local high school, school sports, crimes such as vandalism, zoning issues and other details of community life. However, such "" hyperlocal "" articles are sometimes dismissed as ""chicken dinner"" stories. Leo Lerner, founder of Chicago \'s erstwhile Lerner Newspapers, used to say, ""A fistfight on Clark Street is more important to our readers than a war in Europe."" An increasing number of community newspapers are now owned by large media organizations, although many rural papers are still "" mom and pop "" operations.']";Local journalism significantly impacts communities by shaping how residents understand and engage with their surroundings. For instance, as detailed in the passage, local news reporting plays a vital role in holding community leaders accountable, ensuring that resources are distributed according to public needs. This type of journalism fosters community connection, encouraging collaboration to tackle local issues such as gentrification and racial injustice by providing a platform for dialogue and action among residents.

The Internet is a major  threat to travel agents. Many record stores have been wiped out of business by  the trend toward downloading songs (or illegally “ripping” songs from friends’  CDs—an act to which even the President of the United States has confessed). Although technological change eliminates or at least greatly diminishes some markets,  it creates opportunities for others. For example, although Federal Express has  lost a considerable amount of business from documents that can now be faxed or  sent by the Internet rather than having to be physically shipped, there has  been a large increase in demand for packages to be delivered overnight or  “second day air.” Just-in-time manufacturing techniques, in addition to online  sales, have dramatically increased the market for such shipments.

Yes, despite the industry being tricky and having products that come in sizes that may vary from store to store, fashion remains the queen of sales. The increase in demand in the fashion industry in the online world owes itself mainly to the improvement in returns policies. Previously, it was difficult for somebody to risk buying a shirt, pants, or a jacket without knowing for sure if it was going to fit well. Nowadays returns are free in almost all shops and you can try something on at home, without lines and knowing that you can return it at any time. Indeed, there are lots of sales, but… is it worth getting into this niche?', 'Home Security IP Camera\nSecurity cameras have always been a high-demand product.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) are now being routinely used to ensure health and safety, virtual shopping is at an all-time high due to qurantine and lockdown, and physical interactions have been limited to mobile and online platforms. There are products that have become in demand because of the current pandemic, primarily because there have been drastic changes concerning consumer needs. People now prioritize products and services that allow them to continue working and doing business despite the health crisis. So, what are the in demand products during this time of pandemic that both budding and seasoned entrepreneurs may want to consider manufacturing or distributing? These are some of those: 1. Medical Products. It is obvious that the most in demand products during these trying times are related to the medical or healthcare industry. The demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical devices has especially skyrocketed.', 'However, the rapid uptick in demand has also come with supply chain challenges, too: Many items have been out of stock, resulting in waitlisted shoppers. As Plavsic and her team work to resolve inventory issues and get products back in stock, consumer interest continues to grow—which means that product is flying off digital and physical shelves as soon as it’s made available. Hayley Elliott: Purusha People\nFor Hayley Elliott, the founder of eco-friendly direct-to-consumer yoga wear brand Purusha People, the journey of owning an apparel brand has had many ups and downs: In 2019, her business was suffering—to the point where she believed it would fold. Purusha People\nWith less than $10 left in her account, she decided to pivot her product line, moving away from the metallic leggings her brand was known for and going a completely different route, focusing instead on producing pieces made only from Lenzing-certified eucalyptus tencel fibers. This new material, which is an environmentally friendlier alternative to organic cotton that also uses a closed loop manufacturing process, allowed Elliott to reposition her company in a way that speaks to the growing consumer demand for sustainable apparel. Today, many of the brand’s products quickly sell out and their limited quantity releases are highly coveted. “I was scared to give up selling my metallic leggings, as they were the only income I had at that point,” Elliott said.'];While the passage does not explicitly state that physical products are completely out of demand, it suggests significant shifts due to technological changes and consumer preferences that affect the demand for various types of physical products. For example, Federal Express experienced a decline in business for document shipping due to fax and internet, but saw an increase in demand for overnight package deliveries influenced by online sales and just-in-time manufacturing. Additionally, products like reusable water bottles and home security IP cameras are highlighted as remaining in high demand, indicating that while some physical products may see reduced demand, others continue to thrive or even grow in new market conditions.;['Demand for physical products varies greatly by product type.', 'Online sales growth impacts physical retail significantly.', 'Consumer preference for physical stores remains strong for some products.', 'Supply chain issues and economic downturns affect product availability and demand.', 'Some products necessitate in-person inspection before purchase.', 'High-end and specialty products maintain a strong physical presence.', 'Retailers increasingly adopt omnichannel strategies.', 'Specific product demand fluctuates (e.g., electronics, toilet paper).', 'Certain product categories (e.g., beauty, apparel) remain highly demanded.', 'The pandemic disrupted production and distribution of many products.', 'Personalized products are a growing trend.', 'Consumers value in-person shopping experiences for certain products.', 'Technology-driven products are in high demand.', 'Outmoded products (e.g., DVDs) are declining due to technological advancements.'];['okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital'];['support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support'];0.3333333333333333

Over the past decade, the Hispanic high school dropout rate has declined and college enrollment has increased, even as Hispanics trail other groups in earning a bachelor’s degree. The issue of education is an important one for Hispanics. Roughly eight-in-ten (83%) cited education as very important to their vote in the 2016 election, ranking it alongside the economy, health care and terrorism as a top issue. Yet, for many Hispanics, economic factors remain an obstacle to college enrollment. In a 2014 National Journal poll, 66% of Hispanics who got a job or entered the military directly after high school cited the need to help support their family as a reason for not enrolling in college, compared with 39% of whites. Here are five facts about U.S. Latinos and education: 1 Over the past decade, the Hispanic high school dropout rate has dropped dramatically. The rate reached a new low in 2014, dropping from 32% in 2000 to 12% in 2014 among those ages 18 to 24. This helped lower the national dropout rate from 12% to 7% over the same time period – also a new low.', 'In a 2014 National Journal poll, 66% of Hispanics who got a job or entered the military directly after high school cited the need to help support their family as a reason for not enrolling in college, compared with 39% of whites.

This helped lower the national dropout rate from 12% to 7% over the same time period – also a new low. Even so, the Hispanic dropout rate remains higher than that of blacks (7%), whites (5%) and Asians (1%). 2 Hispanics are making big inroads in college enrollment. In 2014, 35% of Hispanics ages 18 to 24 were enrolled in a two- or four-year college, up from 22% in 1993 – a 13-percentage-point increase. That amounted to 2.3 million Hispanic college students in 2014. By comparison, college enrollment during this time among blacks (33% in 2014) increased by 8 percentage points, and among whites (42% in 2014) the share increased 5 points.', 'More than one in five K-12 students is now Latino. The number of Latinos enrolling in college is increasing rapidly—24 percent within the last year. This is good news, since Latino adults have the lowest educational attainment of any U.S. population group. Only 19 percent of Latinos have a degree, compared with 26 percent of African Americans and 42 percent of Anglos. Simply enrolling in college, however, does not guarantee graduation. Only 36 percent of first-time, full-time Latino students earn a degree within six years, compared with 49 percent of Anglos. For the United States to rise to the top of the world in the percentage of college graduates, the nation needs to graduate an additional 13.4 million students, including 3.3 million Latinos, by 2020. Increasing the number of Latino college graduates requires a coordinated effort, including providing more preschool, middle and high school college counseling. Dropout prevention programs, simplifying college admission and transfer, and improving college affordability will also help Latino kids achieve a college education. Rural vs. Metro\nOne of the most dramatic demographic shifts of the past century has been the transformation of the country from largely rural to largely urban.', 'Despite promising trends, it’s important that we begin to address some of the barriers that Latinos experience in the workforce such as high unemployment rates and lower levels of educational attainment. As one of the fastest-growing populations, it’s crucial that we close these gaps now to have a successful workforce in the future. Educational attainment\nEducation has long been recognized as a gateway to success. As one of the fastest-growing demographics in our country, educational attainment among Latinos is especially important to ensure that our youth are academically equipped to meet the challenges of the future. Educational attainment among young Latinos has progressed significantly over past few years and has led to the narrowing of the education gap between Hispanics and other racial and ethnic groups, particularly when it comes to postsecondary education. While Latinos have been making great strides in educational attainment, they continue to lag behind other racial and ethnic groups. From 2009 to 2010 there was a 24 percent increase in college enrollment among Latinos. The overall number of young adults aged 18 to 24 years old attending college in the United States hit an all-time high in October 2010 at 12.2 million, with Hispanics accounting for 15 percent of that population, or 1.8 million young adults. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, from 2009 to 2010 the number of Hispanic young adults enrolled in college grew by 349,000, compared with an increase of 88,000 young blacks and 43,000 young Asian Americans and a decrease of 320,000 young whites. Certainly the current demographic changes have played a crucial role in the advanced educational attainment levels among young Latinos.', 'Education\nAs the growing numbers of young Latinos enter school, state policymakers recognize their educational success is critical to providing states with a well-educated workforce and ensuring economic vitality. Improving college graduation rates has become a national and state focus to meet future workforce demands and stimulate the economy. And college graduation rates of Latinos—the largest and fastest growing minority group in the nation—is a specific focus. While the aging boomer population is largely Anglo, the rapidly growing younger population is largely Latino. Support for Social Security and Medicare for the older population will rely on a well-educated, competitive Latino workforce. More than one in five K-12 students is now Latino. The number of Latinos enrolling in college is increasing rapidly—24 percent within the last year. This is good news, since Latino adults have the lowest educational attainment of any U.S. population group. Only 19 percent of Latinos have a degree, compared with 26 percent of African Americans and 42 percent of Anglos. Simply enrolling in college, however, does not guarantee graduation.'];The passage does not provide specific statistics on how many Latinos have been misinformed about education. It focuses on presenting data related to educational attainment among Latinos, including trends in high school dropout rates, college enrollment, and the challenges faced in achieving higher education.

Determinism is often contrasted with free will, although some philosophers claim that the two are compatible. Determinism often is taken to mean causal determinism, which in physics is known as cause-and-effect. It is the concept that events within a given paradigm are bound by causality in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. This meaning can be distinguished from other varieties of determinism mentioned below. Other debates often concern the scope of determined systems, with some maintaining that the entire universe is a single determinate system and others identifying other more limited determinate systems (or multiverse ). Numerous historical debates involve many philosophical positions and varieties of determinism. They include debates concerning determinism and free will, technically denoted as compatibilistic (allowing the two to coexist) and incompatibilistic (denying their coexistence is a possibility). Determinism should not be confused with self-determination of human actions by reasons, motives, and desires. Determinism is about interactions which affect our cognitive processes in our life.', ""However, relativity primarily completes the revolution that Newton started and\nis also highly deterministic as is much of classical physics. In the holistic viewpointof\nrelativity theory, concepts such as length, mass and time take on a much\nmore nebulous aspect than they do in the apparently rigid reality of our\neveryday world. However, what relativity takes away with one hand, it\ngives back in the form of new and truly fundamental constants and\nconcepts. The theory of relativityis\ntraditionally broken into two parts, special and general relativity. Special\nrelativity provides a framework for translating physical events and laws into\nforms appropriate for any inertial frame of reference. General relativity\naddresses the problem of accelerated motion and gravity. Special Theory of Relativity: By the late 1800's, it was becoming obvious that there were some serious\nproblems for Newtonian physics concerning the need for absolute space and\ntime when referring to events or interactions (frames of reference). In\nparticular, the newly formulated theory of electromagnetic waves required\nthat light propagation occur in a medium (the waves had to be waves on something). In a Newtonian Universe, there should be no difference in space or time\nregardless of where you are or how fast you are moving."", 'Therefore, free will and determinism are incompatible and consequently there is no free will. Under soft determinism, also known as compatibilism, determinism is true and free will is acting as one wishes, without external constraints. The issue is not whether or not actions are caused, but whether they are caused or prevented by external constraints. Therefore, determinism and free will are compatible. Here is an example to further illustrate the differing ideas of determinism and libertarianism: Suppose you woke up on a Sunday morning and had nothing planned for the day. You decide you would like to go to the mall in the early afternoon. However, it is a warm, beautiful day outside and you might opt for the beach instead. After thinking about the two possibilities for a few minutes, you decide to head to the beach for a day of sun filled fun. After all, you can go to the mall anytime.', 'it is a clash of genuinely incompatible descriptions of reality. The conflict between the two halves of physics has been brewing for more than a century – sparked by a pair of 1905 papers by Einstein, one outlining relativity and the other introducing the quantum – but recently it has entered an intriguing, unpredictable new phase. Two notable physicists have staked out extreme positions in their camps, conducting experiments that could finally settle which approach is paramount. Basically you can think of the division between the relativity and quantum systems as “smooth” versus “chunky”. In general relativity, events are continuous and deterministic, meaning that every cause matches up to a specific, local effect. In quantum mechanics, events produced by the interaction of subatomic particles happen in jumps (yes, quantum leaps), with probabilistic rather than definite outcomes. Quantum rules allow connections forbidden by classical physics. This was demonstrated in a much-discussed recent experiment in which Dutch researchers defied the local effect. They showed that two particles – in this case, electrons – could influence each other instantly, even though they were a mile apart. When you try to interpret smooth relativistic laws in a chunky quantum style, or vice versa, things go dreadfully wrong.', 'Other debates often concern the scope of determined systems, with some maintaining that the entire universe is a single determinate system and others identifying other more limited determinate systems (or multiverse ).

Determinism should not be confused with self-determination of human actions by reasons, motives, and desires. Determinism is about interactions which affect our cognitive processes in our life. It is about the cause and the result of what we have done in our life. Cause and result are always bounded together in our cognitive processes. It assumes that if an observer has sufficient information about an object or human being, that such an observer might be able to predict every consequent move of that object or human being. Determinism rarely requires that perfect prediction be practically possible.

In the context of relativity, events are continuous and deterministic, implying that all events in the universe are determined by causal relationships, with no role for randomness within that framework. Specifically, the theory of relativity maintains that every cause has a specific, measurable effect, following predictable laws of physics that are consistent across different frames of reference.;['General relativity is deterministic, but spacetime curvature complicates causality.', 'Special relativity challenges absolute simultaneity, affecting determinism.', 'Einstein’s block universe view suggests predetermination.', 'Relativistic causality: cause precedes effect for all observers.', 'Classical physics, including relativity, is deterministic.', 'Quantum mechanics introduces indeterminism, conflicting with classical determinism.', 'Many-worlds interpretation offers a deterministic quantum view.', 'Compatibilism: free will and determinism can coexist.', 'Incompatibilism: free will and determinism are mutually exclusive.', 'Determinism: the future is fixed by the present state and natural laws.', 'Causal determinism: every event is necessitated by prior events and laws of nature.'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay'];['partial_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support'];0.5

The society is dominated by youth and glamour therefore the actual role of the elderly has no value. Growing old implies that there is continuous deterioration of mental and physical mechanisms that are essential for effectual performance in the community. A capitalist nation such all in the world today, old age is significantly viewed as been a handicap. The youth does not appreciate the fabulous contribution and the high positions held by the so called the “handicapped”. The elderly should be held in particularly high esteem and idolized for their knowledge, contributions, wisdom and experiences. Perhaps age stratification has affected the elderly tremendously. In the modern society people are mostly segregated on the basis of age. This segregation limits the type of roles in which members of each cluster can hold and work on. This scenario leaves the elderly in a worse off group, leading to conflict in the society.', 'Researchers believe industrialization and modernization have contributed greatly to lowering the power, influence, and prestige the elderly once held. The elderly have both benefitted and suffered from these rapid social changes. In modern societies, a strong economy created new levels of prosperity for many people. Healthcare has become more widely accessible, and medicine has advanced, which allows the elderly to live longer. However, older people are not as essential to the economic survival of their families and communities as they were in the past. Studying Aging Populations\nHow old is this woman?

In addition to genetic differences, health habits, hair dyes, Botox, and the like make traditional signs of aging increasingly unreliable.

Age is an important factor to analyze with accompanying demographic figures, such as income and health.', 'In agrarian societies the elderly have a status of respectability. Their life experiences and knowledge are regarded as valuable, especially in preliterate societies where knowledge is orally transmitted. The range of activities in these societies allows the elderly to continue to be productive members of their communities. In industrialized nations the status of the elderly has altered as the socioeconomic conditions have changed, tending to reduce the status of the elderly as a society becomes more technologically oriented. Since physical disability is less a factor in productive capability in industrialized countries, this reduction in social status is thought to have been generated by several interrelated factors: the numbers of still able-bodied older workers outstripping the number of available employment opportunities, the decline in self-employment which allows a worker to gradually decrease activity with age, and the continual introduction of new technology requiring special training and education. Although in certain fields old age is still considered an asset, particularly in the political arena, older people are increasingly being forced into retirement before their productive years are over, causing problems in their psychological adaptations to old age. Retirement is not regarded unfavourably in all instances, but its economic limitations tend to further remove older people from the realm of influence and raise problems in the extended use of leisure time and housing. As a consequence, financial preparation for retirement has become an increased concern for individuals and society. For an essay on retirement, medical care, and other issues affecting the elderly, see John Kenneth Galbraith’s Notes on Aging, a Britannica sidebar by the distinguished economist, ambassador, and public servant.', 'Also, it allows for participating in society according to their needs, desires, and abilities.

Additionally, there are a lot of misconceptions about older adults since most people are not knowledgeable about aging. These misconceptions include: most older adults cannot live independently, chronologic age determines oldness, most elderly persons have diminished intellectual capacity or are senile, all older people are content and serene, all older persons are resistant to change and older adults cannot be productive or active. The functionalist theory looked at how the different parts of society work together in order for it to function smoothly. With respect to the elderly, functionalists believe that the elders are one of society’s fundamental groups. However, the disengagement theory states that withdrawal from society is a normal behaviour portrayed by the aging individual. This is so because the elderly experiences a reduction in both their physical and mental level of functioning, hence they expects at some point in time they will die, resulting in withdrawal from individuals and society (Cummings and Henry 1961). Additionally, the activity theory seeks to explain that activity levels and social involvement are key aspects in replacing what was lost and went on further to say it is the key to happiness (Havinghurst 1961; Neugarten 1964;']";The elderly indeed serve as important pillars in society, despite perceptions that their role may be diminished in contemporary, technologically driven environments. Historically, in agrarian and preliterate societies, the elderly were revered for their wisdom and life experiences, often playing crucial roles in community guidance and the oral transmission of knowledge. However, modernization and industrialization have shifted societal structures, sometimes overshadowing the valuable contributions of the elderly, yet functionalist theories in sociology still recognize them as fundamental to societal harmony, advocating for their active participation and inclusion to maintain social cohesion and overall well-being.;['Elderly possess valuable wisdom and experience.', 'Many cultures deeply respect their elders.', 'Elderly contribute significantly to society.', 'Elderly pass on values and life lessons.', 'Intergenerational connections strengthen communities.', 'Modern societies sometimes undervalue elderly contributions.', 'Cultural attitudes towards aging vary widely.', 'Access to quality elder care is crucial.', 'Some elderly lack sufficient social support.', 'Ageism negatively impacts elderly well-being.', 'Active aging promotes health and participation.', 'Policies should support active aging and inclusion.', 'Elderly face various health challenges.', 'Economic shifts impact elderly financial security.', 'Advances in healthcare increase elderly population.', 'Elderly advocate for policy changes.', 'Elderly’s economic contributions are substantial.', 'Elderly’s knowledge shapes cultural practices.', 'Elderly’s life experiences enrich society.', 'Support systems for elderly are vital.', 'Ageism creates societal inequalities.', 'Elder abuse is a serious concern.', 'Elderly provide crucial family support.'];['vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital'];['support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support'];0.625

Values. Counselors must incorporate culturally diverse clients’ values and beliefs into the counseling process. Cultural belief systems like spirituality and family-centric issues may in themselves serve as therapeutic vehicles to promote healing. Self-awareness. Counselors must be sensitive to their own inherent racial or cultural identity and privilege, ethnocentrism, prejudice, and stereotypes when interacting with diverse populations. The counselor is constantly aware of how their own attitudes and beliefs impact their perception of the client, the client’s presenting problem, and the counseling relationship of rapport. Flexibility. Counselors must be willing to acknowledge the limitations of their own cultural competency and expertise when dealing with culturally diverse clients.', 'There are several things that a counselor should expect after expressing their values to a  client. The first and most important is that it helps the client to know the heart of the counselor,  according to Herbert, (2016) this shapes the focus, the goals and the counseling path whereby if  the client shares the same values as the counselor, it provides more effective therapy. Expressing  the values whether personal or professional also provides a sketch of the counseling procedure  which ensures that high moral and ethical standards are maintained throughout the therapy. This  understanding ensures that both the counselor and the client maintains professionalism, good  communication, and confidentiality among other morals and values. Being that the counselor is a guide and not a judge, sometimes a counselor is confronted  with issues that are beyond their scope. This means that the counselor is not able to provide the  required therapy. Such situations mostly arise from knowledge and skills mismatch, a difference  in values, attitudes, beliefs and culture (Arredondo, & Toporek, 2004). The situation may also f VALUE OBJECTIVITY IN COUNSELING 3   arise from countertransference and transference whereby the counselor and the client influence  each other’s emotions which becomes difficult to maintain professional boundaries. Finally, a  counselor may find it hard to counsel a client based on the attitudes of the client and refusal of  therapy (Gelso, Nutt Williams, & Fretz, 2014). Based on these possible scenarios, there are a few  actions that a counselor might take when confronted with such situations.', 'The domains are: 1) Counselor self-awareness\n2) Client worldview\n3) Counseling relationship\n4) Counseling and advocacy interventions\nCounselor self-awareness is important for identifying one’s cultural values, beliefs and biases. This insight assists in identifying one’s worldview and hot-button issues that may interfere with helping clients. Second, being cognizant of a client’s cultural values, beliefs and biases may help counselors understand clients’ worldviews and identity development. Next, being aware of the extent to which shared and unshared identities; privileged and marginalized statuses; values, beliefs and biases; and culture influence the counseling relationship may be important in determining appropriate evidence-based treatment interventions. When counselors possess self-awareness, are attuned to clients’ worldviews and are cognizant of how this shapes the counseling relationship, they are better equipped to respond to client needs. To respond effectively, the MSJCC set the expectation that counselors understand the sociocultural systems that are affecting their clients’ sense of well-being and address the corresponding issues appropriately.', ""AMCD Multicultural Counseling Competencies\nAMCD\n \nMulticultural\n \nCounseling\n \nCompetencies\n \nI.\n \nCounselor\n \nAwareness\n \nof\n \nOwn\n \nCultural\n \nValues\n \nand\n \nBiases\n \n\n \nAttitudes\n \nand\n \nBeliefs\n \n\n \nCulturally\n \nskilled\n \ncounselors\n \nbelieve\n \nthat\n \ncultural\n \nself-awareness\n \nand\n \nsensitivity\n \nto\n \none's\n \nown\n \ncultural\n \nheritage\n \nis\n \nessential.

The major elements of social movements are their emergence and recruitment, collective identities, frames or discourses, organizations, tactics or actions, and external contexts or political opportunities. Each of these elements is gendered. First, movements’ emergence and processes of recruitment are gendered because the status of women and men shapes their differential ability and willingness to organize on their own behalf. Gendered factors such as family structures and responsibilities, access to higher education, paid employment, and fertility rate all affect recruitment and participation in activism. These factors all vary according to race, class, and nationality as well as gender, and also change over time; such variations account for some of the differences in the level and form of women’s mobilization cross culturally and historically. Further, social movements emerge along gendered lines because they emerge from gendered preexisting organizations and networks (Taylor 1999). For example, feminist organizing during the late 1960s in the US emerged partially from the Civil Rights Movement, in which women gained organizing experience and an ideology opposing inequality, but also faced gender barriers to full participation. However, grievances and networks based on race and class cross cut those based on gender.', 'Initial works focused on documenting women’s movements, including feminist and non-feminist movements, and explaining their emergence and development. A second phase of work began to analyze gender in social movements more broadly, including masculinity, and to analyze the intersections between gender, race, class, and nationality in social movements. Most recently, numerous scholars have begun to examine the ways that movements are gendered in their origins, collective identities, frames and discourses, organizational structures, tactics, and political and cultural opportunities. In doing so, they contribute to a rethinking of the basic concepts of the field of social movements. These phases are similar to those for scholarship on gender more broadly, which initially focused on documenting women’s experiences and remedying male bias, next on gender as an institution and the intersections between gender and other major forms of social inequality, and lastly on reformulating basic sociological knowledge and theory based on a perspective that makes gender central. Sociological work on gender and social movements thus reflects the influence of the feminist movement on the academy. Many social movements have targeted the social structures, culture, and interactional norms around gender. These include feminist movements, which in many countries focused first on gaining basic political rights such as the vote and the right to own property, and then progressed in later waves to addressing other forms of inequality between women and men ranging from responsibility for child raising and household labor, discrimination in paid employment, sexuality, reproductive rights, health care, stereotyping in the arts and popular culture, election to public office, and so on. Parallel to these movements are anti-feminist movements, which tend to emerge in response to feminist movements and also target gender directly in an attempt to forestall or roll back changes. Other movements have been organized around gender, without taking gender as a central or explicit target.', 'Gender and Social Movements - Sociology of Gender - iResearchNet\nSociology » Sociology of Gender » Gender and Social Movements\nGender and Social Movements\nSocial movements are shaped by gender systems and they also are a source of social change in gender. Some social movements directly attempt to change gender relations; these movements, particularly women’s movements, have been the focus of considerable scholarship.

These structures often provide different degrees and types of access to power for men and women, influenced by their roles within both the state and activist circles. To progress, movements need to identify and act upon these gendered nuances of power, using contextual strategies that may range from targeting specific gendered policies within institutions to utilizing gender-based networks and communities for mobilization and support.

It also includes air rights above the land and underground rights below the land. To be more specific, real estate is real property. There are five main types of real estate as residential, commercial, industrial, land and special use. Residential real estate involves property used for residential purposes – for example, single-family homes, townhouses, condos, duplexes, etc. Commercial real estate, on the other hand, refers to property used exclusively for business purposes, such as offices, hotels, shopping centers, gas stations, grocery stores, and hospitals. Industrial real estate involves property for industries that involve manufacturing, production, distribution, and storage. Some examples for industrial real estate include factories, power plants and warehouses. The category of land involves undeveloped property, agricultural land and vacant land.', 'The distinction is most useful in the real estate world, where different ideas might apply to owners versus renters or leasers. To most of the general public, the idea of real estate encompasses real property, but from a legal perspective, the distinction is important. The real property consists of both physical objects and common law rights; real estate only consists of physical objects. Real Estate\nReal estate is simply a piece of land plus any natural or artificial—man-made—improvements that are attached or have been added. Natural attachments are part of the land and include trees, water, valuable mineral deposits, and oil. Artificial improvements include buildings, sidewalks, and fences.

However, the new law may indirectly affect behavioral health or other health care facilities that accept homeless patients discharged from a hospital. Practical Tips and Takeaways\nHospitals should review their discharge planning policies and procedures now and revise them as appropriate to ensure compliance with this new law. Hospitals should also consider circumstances where they may need to take legal action to discharge a homeless patient. Hospitals should consider appropriate training for discharge planning staff, certain medical staff and other personnel who may be part of a patient’s care team to ensure organization-wide compliance with the new law. Training protocols and other required aspects of a written homeless discharge plan must be in place as of July 1, 2019, although it may be advisable to put them in place as of January 1, 2019 given the close relationship they will have to other homeless discharge policies and procedures that must be implemented by January 1, 2019. Affected hospitals should begin or continue coordination and communication efforts with appropriate agencies, other health care providers and nonprofit social services providers now. Currently, SB 1152 only focuses on hospitals and does not contain language that obligates receiving behavioral health or other health care facilities to accept homeless patients.', 'Joan Burke, advocacy director for Loaves, said the system for serving an estimated 2,000 homeless people in Sacramento County “is over-saturated. But hospitals have a moral and legal duty to discharge people to a suitable place.” Brian Jensen, regional vice president of the Hospital Council of Northern and Central California, agreed. But if some people fall through the cracks, “it’s not for a lack of good intentions or effort,” he said. California’s Health and Safety Code requires hospitals to have a discharge policy for all patients, including those who are homeless. Hospitals must make prior arrangements for patients, either with family, at a care home, or at another appropriate agency, the code says. But the task is easier said than done for health professionals dealing with people who have no place to live and may have mental illnesses and other complicated problems, said Jan Emerson-Shea, vice president of external affairs for the California Hospital Association. “Hospitals try to do a ‘warm hand-off’ if possible,” Emerson-Shea said. “ But if the person is homeless, who do the hospitals call? There are only so many shelter beds.', 'Senate Bill 1152: California’s Hospital Discharge Policy for Homeless Patients and How It May Affect Substance Use Disorder Treatment Providers | Polsinelli - JDSupra\nNovember 1, 2018\nSenate Bill 1152: California’s Hospital Discharge Policy for Homeless Patients and How It May Affect Substance Use Disorder Treatment Providers\nJonathon Cohn, Paul Gomez, Erin Muellenberg, Ima Nsien, Richard Rifenbark\nPolsinelli\nWhat are the Material Changes to the Current Law? Governor Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill (SB) 1152 into law on September 30, 2018. SB 1152 modifies Section 1262.5 of the Health & Safety Code which currently requires hospitals to have a written discharge planning policy and procedure that provides for appropriate post-hospital care for patients after discharge. Existing law focuses on those patients who are likely to suffer adverse health consequences after being discharged from the hospital if there is no adequate discharge planning. The new law goes further by focusing specifically on homeless patients. Effective January 1, 2019, SB 1152 will require hospitals to modify their current hospital discharge policies by including a written homeless patient discharge planning policy and procedure. Hospitals must revise current discharge policies to assist homeless patients in preparing for their return to the community by helping them identify a post-discharge destination, with priority given to identifying a sheltered destination with supportive services. Prior to discharging a homeless patient, hospitals are required to document and perform a checklist of events, such as offering the homeless patient a meal, screening for infectious disease, weather-appropriate clothing and transportation to a certain destination within a 30 mile radius.', 'Hospitals should also consider circumstances where they may need to take legal action to discharge a homeless patient. Hospitals should consider appropriate training for discharge planning staff, certain medical staff and other personnel who may be part of a patient’s care team to ensure organization-wide compliance with the new law.

Currently, SB 1152 only focuses on hospitals and does not contain language that obligates receiving behavioral health or other health care facilities to accept homeless patients. Receiving facilities should consider implementing their own policies regarding homeless patient transfers and how to address the risks associated with accepting homeless patients. Behavioral health or other health care facilities should be aware of the homeless patient discharge planning policies of the hospitals from which they regularly receive patients. Hospitals may want to seek written acknowledgement from the receiving entity that it will accept the homeless patient and assume responsibility for the patient.

While the Chinese government has long scrutinized individual citizens for evidence of disloyalty to the regime, only now is it beginning to develop comprehensive, constantly updated, and granular records on each citizen’s political persuasions, comments, associations, and even consumer habits. The new social credit system under development will consolidate reams of records from private companies and government bureaucracies into a single “citizen score” for each Chinese citizen. In its comprehensive 2014 planning outline, the CCP explains a goal of “keep [ing] trust and constraints against breaking trust.” While the system is voluntary for now, it will be mandatory by 2020. Already, 100,000 Chinese citizens have posted on social media about high scores on a “Sesame Credit” app operated by Alibaba, in a private-sector precursor to the proposed government system. The massive e-commerce conglomerate claims its app is only tracking users’ financial and credit behavior, but promises to offer a “holistic rating of character.” It is not hard to imagine many Chinese boasting soon about their official scores. While it isn’t yet clear what data will be considered, commentators are already speculating that the scope of the system will be alarmingly wide. The planned “citizen credit” score will likely weigh far more data than the Western FICO score, which helps lenders make fast and reliable decisions on whether to extend financial credit.', 'The Chinese government is now tracking virtually \nevery social \nmovement and behavior of all of its citizens (watch the video below), including who attends \nchurch, buys Bibles, and where those Bibles are taken. Totalitarian Control\nThe Chinese government is coupling this Orwellian mass surveillance with a totalitarian ""social credit system"" that scores and controls the \nbehavior and the speech of its citizens. Every Chinese citizem is assigned a social credit \nscore that rises and falls with behaviors the government deems good and bad, \nrespectively. For example, donating money to a charity the government has \napproved or \ndonating blood raises the score, while spreading a rumor or jaywalking lowers \nit. People with high scores get lower interest rate bank loans and discounted utility \nbills, while those with low scores are forbidden from getting loans, getting \ntrain or flight tickets, and enrolling their children in certain schools. In the (near) future, believing or spreading the ""spiritual opium"" of \nChristianity, attending ""illegal""\nunderground \nchurches, and buying or owning a Bible other than the Communism-friendly ""Bible"" \nthat the Communist Party is currently writing (see\nChinese Bibleand ""Sinicization \nof Christianity"") are expected to be added as major score-lowering offenses \nto this system, whose penal code is also expected to expand to include prison \nterms. Is Christianity in China doomed? Persecuting Christianity is like throwing water on an oil fire; it spreads \nand expands \nthe fire. The intensifying persecution will purify the church in China, \ncut the current crossover traffic between the \nThree Self churchand the\nunderground \nchurch, drive true Christians into the latter, reduce the freedom \nof foreign missionaries, and \nmay provide renewed impetus for smuggling Biblesinto and clandestine Bible printinginside China.', 'a score of 600, for example, qualifies for an “instant loan” of about $800. At 650, renting a car no longer requires a deposit. At 700, a citizen is fast-tracked for a Singapore travel permit; higher travel visas such as to Europe will be granted for even higher scores. A specific high score may be required to get specific high-status and influential jobs. “With the help of the latest internet technologies the government wants to exercise individual surveillance,” stated Rogier Creemers, a Belgian China-specialist at Oxford University. “ Government and big internet companies in China can exploit ‘Big Data’ together in a way that is unimaginable in the West.” [ Prepare to become a Certified Information Security Systems Professional with this comprehensive online course from PluralSight.

The mass murder committed by the party and its Red Guards during the Great Leap Forward (1958-1962) and the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) alone resulted in some 70 million dead. And these numbers do not even take into account the forced abortions stemming from China’s one-child policy. That number is conservatively estimated to be 500 million—500 million children murdered in the womb. The Chinese government today is perfecting a system of social credit scoring that relies on constant monitoring of its people using the tools of social media, with the aim of grading each individual based on his or her support of the regime. This exerts a chilling effect on the people, who seem to have decided to go along with their communist masters lest they be excluded from whatever benefits they might enjoy from China’s economic modernization. Many of us have heard of the CCP’s imprisonment in concentration camps of one to two million Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang province. Fewer of us are aware of how the Chinese government facilitates the abduction of Uyghur women for sexual use by Chinese soldiers—or even worse, if that were possible, how the government harvests the organs of the Uyghur population for sale both in China and abroad. This latter atrocity has become a multi-billion dollar industry: the Uyghur organs, since they are uncorrupted by alcohol or pork, are especially desirable to wealthy Muslims in the Middle East and elsewhere.', 'Citizens’ living conditions: China has worked closely with the International Labor Organization (ILO) to improve its citizens’ living conditions. It has done this by providing a better social security and welfare program which covers unemployment, pension, medical care, employment injury and maternity for urban employees. Additionally, this program includes what is known as the “Dibao,” the minimum living guarantee program, which ensures that even the poorest residents in either urban or rural areas would be supported by the government. Global impact: China’s poverty alleviation program is not only a domestic policy but also an international policy. It has benefitted many developing countries around the world. The Chinese government has provided about 400 billion yuan ($59 billion) in aid, which has benefitted 166 countries and international organizations. Additionally, more than 600,000 aid workers were sent overseas to contribute to the poverty-reduction efforts. China has also pledged $2 billion to the Assistance Fund for South-South Cooperation in order to support developing countries to reach the U.N.’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.']";The Chinese government heavily censors and controls the behaviors and expressions of its citizens through a comprehensive surveillance system and the social credit score system. This system scores citizens based on their behaviors, with activities deemed favorable by the government, such as donating to approved charities, increasing one's score, and negative behaviors like spreading rumors or unauthorized religious activities lowering it. Consequences of one's social credit score range from benefits like lower interest rates and easier access to travel permits for high scorers to restrictions like travel bans and limited school options for low scorers, illustrating a broad scope of control over personal freedoms.;['Extensive internet censorship', 'Mass surveillance via facial recognition', 'Severe speech restrictions', 'Control over information and media', 'Propaganda campaigns', 'Punishments for dissent', 'Crackdown on activists and journalists', 'Blocking of international news and websites', 'Restrictions on social media and VPNs', 'Algorithmic surveillance and data collection', 'Social credit system', 'Self-censorship due to fear of reprisal'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay'];['support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support'];0.8

Author Jack Miles believes this genre has a high potential to cause harm and mental trauma to the real people involved. True crime media can be produced without the consent of the victim's family, which can lead to their being re-traumatized. Recent discussions about the consumption of true crime media have also focused on the impact on the audience's mental health. Depending on the writer, true crime can adhere strictly to well-established facts in journalistic fashion or can be highly speculative. Writers can selectively choose which information to present and which to leave out in order to support their narrative.

The House voted 357-66 in favor of the measure, while the Senate voted 98-1 with only Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., dissenting. President Bush signed the behemoth bill into law on Oct. 26, 2001. The name of the act perhaps helped ensure its easy passage; USA PATRIOT stands for Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism. The massive law, 342 pages long, amends at least 15 separate federal laws, including the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, the Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act. The law permits roving wiretaps and so-called “sneak and peek” warrants, adds new terrorist crimes, knocks down the wall between foreign and domestic intelligence, amends the definition of domestic terrorism and makes many other changes too numerous to catalog. John Whitehead, founder of the Rutherford Institute, has written that “the Patriot Act violates at least six of the ten original amendments known as the Bill of Rights — the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Amendments — and possibly the Thirteenth and Fourteenth as well.” Most of the criticism of the Patriot Act concerns its seeming infringements on Fourth Amendment rights.', 'The act passed through Congress with widespread support. Senate passage occurred on October 11, 2001, and House passage occurred the next day. The House passed a “clean” bill on October 24, 2001, which both incorporated and resolved differences between the House and Senate measures. The Senate agreed on the changes the following day, with just one dissenting vote and one nonvoting member. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law on October 26, 2001. The Patriot Act, by amending old legislation and incorporating new provisions, has expanded greatly the authority of federal officials. In addition, executive orders and related legislation have further expanded federal power in the fight against terrorism. The act and its ancillaries aid federal authorities in their efforts to close off U.S. borders to foreign terrorists, detain and remove terrorists already within U.S. borders, and cut off financial resources utilized by terrorists and terrorist organizations. Patriot Act expanded government authority to conduct secret searches and surveillance\nLaw enforcement agencies are empowered with the means to conduct secret searches, surveillance of telephone and Internet communications, and acquisition of individuals’ private records (including medical and student records) without probable cause for the purpose of intelligence-gathering. One example of the federal government’s extensive reach involved its controversial seizure of telephone and cell phone records from telephone companies without being required to show reasonable suspicion or probable cause.', 'We are at war,"" Ashcroft says, ""and we have to do things differently than we did before."" He points out that the only purpose of the Patriot Act is ""to prevent terrorists from unleashing more death and destruction."" Ashcroft also argues that the courts and Congress still safeguard the constitutional rights of Americans. Public opinion has consistently supported the Patriot Act. An August 2003 Gallup Poll asked whether the Patriot Act goes too far, is about right, or doesn\'t go far enough in restricting people\'s civil liberties. Only 22 percent responded that it goes too far. Forty-eight percent said it is about right, and 21 percent answered that it does not go far enough. In June 2003, the attorney general called for another law to further strengthen the powers of law enforcement to fight terrorists. Called ""Patriot Act II"" by critics, the proposed new law would, among other things, enable the government to ask a court to revoke the citizenship of any American who provides ""material support"" to terrorists. The courts are just beginning to review the constitutionality of the Patriot Act.', '357; Nays: 66)\nPassed the Senate on October 25, 2001 ( Yeas: 98; Nays: 1)\nSigned into law by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001\nThe history of the USA PATRIOT Act involved many parties who opposed and supported the legislation, which was proposed, enacted and signed into law 45 days after the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. The USA PATRIOT Act, though approved by large majorities in the U.S. Senate and House of Representative, was controversial, and parts of the law were invalidated or modified by successful legal challenges over constitutional infringements to civil liberties. The Act had several sunset provisions, most reauthorized by the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 and the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act. Both reauthorizations incorporated amendments to the original USA PATRIOT Act, and other federal laws. The catalyst for the USA PATRIOT Act occurred on September 11, 2001 when terrorists attacked and destroyed the World Trade Center in New York City and the western side of the Pentagon near Washington D.C. Within a few weeks of the September 11 attacks, a number of bills attempting to make changes to anti-terrorism laws were introduced into Congress.', 'After the passage of the Patriot Act in 2001, our rights to privacy as citizens were signed away. Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) was the only senator who voted no to the bill that gave massive new powers to the DOJ. Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA) didn’t vote yes or no. The House vote for the 2001 bill was also pretty one-sided - the Patriot Act passed 357-66. When it came up for reauthorization in 2006, the Senate passed it 89-10 (there were several who voted yes in 2001 and no in 2006) and the house passed it 280-138. And in 2011, the Patriot Act was extended through 2015 on an 86-12 vote in the Senate, and a 275-144 vote in the House. You can see how your members of Congress voted here, here and here. And it’s important to note that presidents of both parties signed extensions of the Patriot Act into law.

Since 9/11, about 5,000 Americans have been killed by U.S. police officers, which is almost equivalent to the number of U.S. soldiers who have been killed in the line of duty in Iraq. Because individual police departments are not required to submit information regarding the use of deadly force by its officers, some bloggers have taken it upon themselves to aggregate that data. Wikipedia also has a list of “ justifiable homicides ” in the U.S., which was created by documenting publicized deaths. Mike Prysner, one of the local directors of the Los Angeles chapter for ANSWER — an advocacy group that asks the public to Act Now to Stop War and End Racism — told Mint Press News earlier this year that the “epidemic” of police harassment and violence is a nationwide issue. He said groups like ANSWER are trying to hold officers accountable for abuse of power. “ [ Police brutality] has been an issue for a very long time,” Prysner said, explaining that in May, 13 people were killed in Southern California by police. As Mint Press News previously reported, each year there are thousands of claims of police misconduct. According to the CATO Institute’s National Police Misconduct Reporting Project, in 2010 there were 4,861 unique reports of police misconduct involving 6,613 sworn officers and 6,826 alleged victims. Most of those allegations of police brutality involved officers who punched or hit victims with batons, but about one-quarter of the reported cases involved firearms or stun guns.', 'The officer involved was acquitted of criminal charges. Police violence and excessive force statistics\nThe following information was obtained from Mapping Police Violence’s report on 2019 deaths caused by police unless otherwise noted. Police killed 1,098 people in 2019. 429 civilians have been fatally shot by police as of June 4, 2020. 24% of the people killed by police in 2019 were Black. There were only 27 days in 2019 where police did not kill someone. Black people killed by police are 1.3 times more likely to be unarmed than white people. 99% of killings by police officers from 2013-2019 have not resulted in the officers involved being charged with a crime. From 2013-2019, the Austin Police Department killed 31 people. 42% of these people had a mental illness.', 'For the last five years, the police have fatally shot about 1,000 civilians annually, the vast majority of whom were armed or otherwise dangerous. Black people account for about 23% of those shot and killed by police; they are about 13% of the U.S. population. As of the June 22 update, the Washington Post’s database of fatal police shootings showed 14 unarmed Black victims and 25 unarmed white victims in 2019. The database does not include those killed by other means, like George Floyd. The number of unarmed Black shooting victims is down 63% from 2015, when the database began. There are about 7,300 Black homicide victims a year. The 14 unarmed victims in fatal police shootings would comprise only 0.2% of that total. Ideally, officers would never take anyone’s life in the course of their duties. But given the number of arrests they make each year ( around 10 million) and the number of deadly-weapons attacks on officers ( an average of 27 per day in just two-thirds of the nation’s police departments, according to a 2014 analysis), it is not clear that these 1,000 civilian shooting deaths suggest that law enforcement is out of control.', 'According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report, in 2013 there were 461 “justifiable homicides” by police — defined as “the killing of a felon by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty.” In all but three of these reported killings, officers used firearms. The true number of fatal police shootings is surely much higher, however, because many law enforcement agencies do not report to the FBI database. Attempts by journalists to compile more complete data by collating local news reports have resulted in estimates as high as 1,000 police killings a year. There is no way to know how many victims, like Brown, were unarmed. By contrast, there were no fatal police shootings in Great Britain last year. Not one. In Germany, there have been eight police killings over the past two years. In Canada — a country with its own frontier ethos and no great aversion to firearms — police shootings average about a dozen a year.

What they found was that health goes beyond where children eat, it's why they eat there, and what sorts of eating habits they observe in their families. 'The study presented strong evidence that the children's diet beyond fast- food consumption is more strongly linked to poor nutrition and obesity,' said Jennifer Poti, doctoral candidate in UNC's Department of Nutrition and co-author of the study. ' While reducing fast-food intake is important, the rest of a child's diet should not be overlooked.' Furthermore, Popkin said that taking the time to enforce healthy eating habits from a young age will lead children to become healthier adults. 'Children who rely on fast foods may tend to have parents who do not have the means, desire or time to purchase or prepare healthy foods at home,' Popkin said.

The term ageism was first used by gerontologist Robert N. Butler to describe the discrimination of older adults. 2 \ufeff Today, the term is often applied to any type of age-based discrimination, whether it involves prejudice against children, teenagers, adults, or senior citizens. Manifestations of ageism are frequently cited in workplace situations, where it can lead to pay disparities or difficulty finding employment. Younger adults may have difficulty finding jobs and receive lower pay due to their perceived lack of experience, while older adults may have problems achieving promotions, finding new work, and changing careers. 3 \ufeff\nStereotypes That Contribute to Ageism\nResearchers Susan Fiske has suggested that stereotypes about older people often relate to how younger people expect them to behave. 4 \ufeff\nThe first stereotype she described relates to succession. Younger people often assume that older individuals have ""had their turn,"" and should make way for the younger generations.\u200b\nThe second stereotype relates to what Fiske refers to as consumption. Younger people frequently feel that limited resources should be spent on themselves rather than on older adults. Finally, young people also hold stereotypes about the identity of older adults.', 'While neither tendency is objectively superior to the other, older people hold up their own behavior as the standard by which all other behavior should be judged. Young people are subject to false negative stereotypes. Young people face negative stereotyping in the media, as well as in everyday life. However, stereotypes about young people are often hard to pin down because they contradict each other. Doing the exact opposite of what one stereotype says simply means we’ll be proving another. We’re trapped in a “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” situation. For example, we’re accused of being both: “Easily manipulated” but also “stubborn and rebellious.” “Violent and criminal,” but also “innocent and fragile.” “Angsty” but also “frivolous.”', 'We are less likely to be seen as individuals. Young people are unfairly lumped together in a way that older people are not. Whenever a young person does something wrong, society tends to blame “kids these days.” But whenever an older person does something wrong, society tends to blame only that individual and not “adults these days.” For example, people of all ages do odd and self-destructive things all the time, but it is never seen as part of a larger trend. However, one or two isolated cases of young people doing odd and self-destructive things are enough for the media to tell everyone that there is a “dangerous trend” among young people, when in fact almost no one is doing it. Our desire for independence is treated like a mental disorder. According to the manual used for classifying mental disorders, symptoms that suggest a need for treatment include: arguing with adults and other authority figures; refusing to comply with adults’ rules;', 'The reasons for this range from vague feelings that younger people are more ""dynamic"" and create a positive image for the company, to more concrete concerns about regulations granting older employees higher salaries or other benefits without these expenses being fully justified by an older employees\' greater experience. Some people consider that teenagers and youth (around 15-25 years old) are victims of adultism, age discrimination framed as a paternalistic form of protection. In seeking social justice, they feel that it is necessary to remove the use of a false moral agenda in order to achieve agency and empowerment. This perspective is based on the grounds that youth should be treated more respectfully by adults and not as second-class citizens. Some suggest that social stratification in age groups causes outsiders to incorrectly stereotype and generalize the group, for instance that all adolescents are equally immature, violent or rebellious, listen to rock tunes, and do drugs. Some have organized groups against age discrimination. Ageism is the causal effect of a continuum of fears related to age. [ How to reference and link to summary or text] This continuum includes: Pediaphobia: the fear of infants or small children.', 'While doing some of these things might also be unacceptable for older people in certain circumstances, young people are more likely to be told that these behaviors are a sign of a disorder and that medication is necessary in order to comply with these expectations. Our behavior is defined from an adult point of view. When there’s a difference between what is seen as typical adult behavior and youthful behavior, the qualities of young people tend to be viewed as defects, whereas those of older people tend to be viewed as normal. For example, young people get labeled as “moody,” instead of older people being labeled as “apathetic.” Young people are labeled as “risk-takers” instead of older people being labeled as “afraid to take risks.” While neither tendency is objectively superior to the other, older people hold up their own behavior as the standard by which all other behavior should be judged.

Buying in bulk (large quantities) is usually cheaper than buying small quantities in multiple transactions, but poor people are less likely to have cash on hand to finance a large purchase of food needed for the more distant future. Poor people are less able to afford delivery or automobile transport of quantities too large to carry on public transit or bicycle. People who live in food deserts without access to fast transportation may buy more expensive food from nearby convenience stores, and have more difficulty transporting perishable goods. Banking – People who cannot maintain a minimum daily balance in a savings account are often charged fees by the bank, whereas people with larger amounts of wealth can earn interest on savings and substantial returns from investments.

Many people are born poor, meaning their family was living in poverty when they started life, and some people end up there from losing a job, or incurring overwhelming healthcare bills that force them into bankruptcy. Major life events such as marriage, divorce or a sudden death in the family can also force people into poverty. It is well documented that having less education can impact your financial future. In 2018, college graduates in the US earned weekly wages that were 80% higher than those who had only graduated highschool. A person’s health status can also affect how rich or poor they are. Poor people have higher rates of chronic diseases, as well as recorded mental health difficulties. This can be a result of the ongoing stress of being poor, and the environments people in poverty are forced to live in. Poor children are twice as likely as others to have unhealthy levels of lead in their blood, for example. The reasons people are poor are multifaceted.', '1. The Loss of Income\nThe obvious, straightforward answer of how unemployment creates poverty is through the loss of income. With joblessness comes a loss of income, and many families are left without sufficient incomes to meet living expenses. This can lead to indebtedness from borrowing money to support one’s needs, use of savings or even to homelessness and malnutrition if individuals are unable to find other sources of finance. When individuals are forced to use savings to cover costs today, their future retirement funds are reduced. This creates negative long-term effects on the economy such as high levels of youth unemployment around the world. Youth unemployment today will decrease the incomes of future retirees and increase the burden on the government. 2. Perpetuating the Poverty Cycle\nWith current levels of youth unemployment increasing the chances of poverty in the future, the burden to work is more heavily placed on future generations. With unemployment shocks such as this, individuals remain in a poverty cycle.', 'It’s been found that the characteristics of living in poor neighborhoods create a poverty trap as families don’t have the necessary tools to become employed. When living in impoverished areas individuals experience low-quality housing, underfunded schools and restricted access to public transportation and services. These outcomes reduce an individual’s chances of finding employment again. The Vicious Cycle\nWhile unemployment can create poverty, poverty also reduces the chance of being employed. To ensure that those who are affected by unemployment do not fall into the negative cycle, researchers believe that governments should focus on improving quality education and training all young people so they remain in school. More should be done to provide job protections which can help decrease the chance of violence and crime in the future. Poverty and unemployment go hand-in-hand, and this relationship is important to remember when trying to create solutions for the the two global issues of unemployment and poverty. – Tess Hinteregger\nPhoto: Flickr', 'The loss of job, unemployment or failure of a business\nUnplanned pregnancy\nDeath of the earning member of a family\nFinancial mismanagement\nloss of personal savings\nDebt that keeps on increasing\nDivorce or a break-up and one member is not equipped to handle the financial burden\nEviction or foreclosure\nCriminal activities that can lead to prison and financial disaster for the rest of the family\nLoss of economic assets\nFactors that maintain the cycle of poverty\nOnce a family is poor, it becomes very difficult for it to escape the circumstances.

The concept of rent-seeking would also apply to corruption of bureaucrats who solicit and extract ""bribe"" or ""rent"" for applying their legal but discretionary authority for awarding legitimate or illegitimate benefits to clients. For example, tax officials may take bribes for lessening the tax burden of the taxpayers. Regulatory capture is a related term for the collusion between firms and the government agencies assigned to regulate them, which is seen as enabling extensive rent-seeking behavior, especially when the government agency must rely on the firms for knowledge about the market. Studies of rent-seeking focus on efforts to capture special monopoly privileges such as manipulating government regulation of free enterprise competition. The term monopoly privilege rent-seeking is an often-used label for this particular type of rent-seeking. Often-cited examples include a lobby that seeks economic regulations such as tariff', 'What identifies rent-seeking behavior is that resources are spent in an attempt to influence policy in order to obtain a greater share of benefits. The benefits targeted by rent-seeking vary but include: profits from state-created monopolies, favorable government contracts, beneficial regulations, tariffs that dampen foreign competition, and tax preferences and subsidies. The major economic concerns of rent-seeking can be categorized into three types of inefficiencies: Resources are wasted engaging in rent-seeking. Policies sought by rent-seeking result in an inefficient use of resources. Rent-seeking policies may prove so destructive that they cause resources to sit idle. The first inefficiency created by rent-seeking is that private resources are intentionally wasted on pursuing and competing for rents rather than producing economic gain. An important caveat of this waste is that it is irrelevant whether or not the rent-seeker achieves the sought-after policy goal. What triggers this waste is the fact that time, effort, and resources were diverted away from producing goods or rendering services that others are willing to pay for and instead used to influence policy for private gain.', 'The second economic concern of rent-seeking behavior is that the policy positions sought and protected create a misallocation of government or private resources. In the case of government resources, it may be that scarce government revenue is used to create a special interest tax subsidy instead of investing in research or infrastructure that would be more beneficial to society as a whole. Private resources may also be misallocated. Without proper regulations, for example, banks may overleverage themselves if they believe that the federal government will bail them out. Finally, rent-seeking could prove so harmful to the economy that not only are resources not used in the most efficient manner possible, but they are actually idle. During a recession or its aftermath, for instance, workers are unemployed and significant capital remains on the sidelines. Indeed, some argue that the 2008 financial crisis—the effects of which we are still suffering from—was fueled by rent-seeking behavior. A paper on tariffs and monopolies by Gordon Tullock of George Mason University emphasized this idea—that both the ends and means of rent-seeking can waste resources—nearly 50 years ago. Originally, only the increased cost on consumers was recognized as a domestic economic effect of tariffs and monopolies, as they allowed domestic firms to charge a higher price than they could with unrestrained competition. This zero-sum transfer, however, looks worse when other factors are introduced.', 'With recent court rulings knocking down important restrictions on money in politics, rent-seekers will have even greater opportunity to seek special favors, doing further harm to the economy. Rent-seeking\nMost economists agree that rent-seeking causes a net societal loss that harms the economy. Rent-seeking involves spending resources to influence a division of profits, instead of creating a good or service that other businesses or individuals are willing to pay an amount that exceeds the cost of producing said good or service. While rent-seeking exists in both private and public forms, the scope of this paper is the discussion public rent-seeking and specifically two public rent-seeking activities—lobbying and campaign funding. When engaging in rent-seeking from public institutions, businesses and individuals may seek favors from the government through both legal activities—lobbying and contributing to political campaigns—and illegal strategies—bribery and corruption. What identifies rent-seeking behavior is that resources are spent in an attempt to influence policy in order to obtain a greater share of benefits. The benefits targeted by rent-seeking vary but include: profits from state-created monopolies, favorable government contracts, beneficial regulations, tariffs that dampen foreign competition, and tax preferences and subsidies.

For example, when a government issues limited taxi licenses, it artificially constrains the supply of taxi services. This restriction forces consumers to pay higher fees, part of which is transferred as excess profits to the taxi business proprietors, thereby blocking potential competitors and alternative services from entering the market. This type of regulation not only limits the options available to consumers but also inhibits the efficient allocation of resources across the economy.;['Rent-seeking blocks competition, raising prices', 'Forced exchanges via inflated prices, blocked alternatives', 'Rent-seeking leads to forced transfers from consumers', 'Regulatory capture enables unfair advantages', 'Rent-seeking manipulates policy for private gain', 'Political influence blocks efficient resource allocation', 'Rent-seeking tactics create unfair market advantages', 'Government-granted monopolies stifle competition', 'Rent-seeking restricts market entry', 'Artificial scarcity restricts consumer choice', 'Misallocation of resources reduces efficiency', 'Rent control creates black markets', 'Key money payments circumvent rent control', 'Landlord harassment forces rent-controlled tenants out', 'Strong rent controls create slums and abandonment', 'Rent control discourages investment, worsening shortages', 'Lobbying creates artificial scarcity, blocking exchanges', 'Blockbusting inflates housing prices', 'Predatory pricing eliminates competitors', 'Price controls distort market signals', 'Rent control prevents market-clearing rents', 'Barriers to entry limit competition', 'Poorly drafted leases enable tenant exploitation'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay'];['support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'not_support'];0.875

In Q3 2019, industry analysts began seeing signs of a deficit in 8-inch (200mm) silicon wafers. The problem was a result of 3 overlapping, concurrent issues: surging demand, manufacturing difficulties, and international commerce tensions. First, 5G network deployments and rising interest in electric automobiles resulted in a high demand for integrated circuits (ICs). Second, foundries could not significantly increase wafer output because they lack the equipment needed to fabricate the older, 8-inch wafer type. Third, Chinese chipmakers began stockpiling silicon to avoid future and retaliatory tariffs issued by Washington and Beijing. Even with wafer foundries working at 99 percent capacity, those three factors introduced disruption to the global component sector. In Q1 2020, COVID-19 reached pandemic proportions and prompted a widespread sequence of regional, government-mandated lockdowns. Those production shutdowns negatively impacted silicon and semiconductor production, which worsened existing supply.', 'So, what caused this microchip shortage? The overly-simplified answer is the pandemic. But the real answer is understandably more complicated. RELATED: The 2021 Ford F-150 Is Struggling With the Chip Shortage\nTo be fair, the pandemic is arguably the biggest factor in the microchip shortage.

In the spring, demand for cars fell. In response, automakers cut orders for microchips. At the same time, the demand for consumer electronics—notably the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, as well as laptops and desktops for working from home—skyrocketed. Microchip suppliers adjusted production accordingly, and now that car demand has recovered much more quickly than expected, suppliers haven\'t been ready to respond. ""With lead times of six to nine months, the semiconductor industry has not been able to scale up fast enough to meet this unexpected growth in automotive demand,"" auto supplier Continental told Car and Driver in a statement. "" The bottlenecks from the semiconductor industry are expected to continue well into 2021, causing major disruptions in Continental\'s production."" © Comezora via Getty Making Circuit Board Production Line\nAdditionally, several moves by the Trump administration in the U.S.-China trade war resulted in fewer semiconductors coming into the marketplace, ultimately exacerbating the supply glut, Gupta said. And then, lastly, the older microchips that the auto industry relies on—commonly referred to as eight-inch wafers—can\'t be produced quickly enough by automotive chip manufacturers such as NXP Semiconductors and Infineon due to manufacturing limitations. Through the second half of last year, new-vehicle inventories were much lower than the industry prefers, and although inventories have made a recovery, they are still lower than where they were at this time last year.']";The passage does not mention any steel shortages affecting microchip production. Instead, it outlines several other factors that contributed to the microchip shortages. These include a high demand for consumer electronics, disruptions in production due to the COVID-19 pandemic, tariffs and trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and the specific shortages of 8-inch silicon wafers needed for manufacturing older types of microchips used in the automotive industry. The passage suggests that these combined circumstances, rather than a shortage of steel, have played a crucial role in exacerbating the microchip shortage situation.;['No direct link between steel and microchip shortages'];['vital'];['support'];1.0

Market Research\nOne effect of confidence intervals in businesses is in determining the reliability of market research. Marketing is an important function for most firms, particularly when estimating their level of future sales. A company will want to have an idea of how many products it will sell in a given financial period, but cannot know the true number with certainty until after the end of the period. By collecting data from customers, past sales numbers and other sources, a company can statistically estimate the value of future sales. By using a confidence interval, the company can determine the range its sales are likely to fall. Risk Management\nBecause it is impossible to predict a future event with 100 percent accuracy, confidence intervals are used by businesses to manage risk.

An important tool for business statistics is a confidence interval, which helps a business evaluate the reliability of a particular estimate. Because no estimate can be 100 percent reliable, businesses must be able to know how confident they should be in their estimates and whether or not to act on them. Confidence Intervals\nIn statistics, a confidence interval gives the percentage probability that an estimated range of possible values in fact includes the actual value being estimated. For example, a business might estimate that a machine uses 10 lbs. of plastic for each unit of a product created. Because the machine cannot be expected to use precisely 10 lbs. per unit, a confidence interval can be created to give a range of possibilities. The company might predict that there is a 95 percent chance that the machine uses on average between 9.85 and 10.5 lbs. of plastic per unit.', 'By using a confidence interval, the company can determine the range its sales are likely to fall. Risk Management\nBecause it is impossible to predict a future event with 100 percent accuracy, confidence intervals are used by businesses to manage risk. For example, if a company is 95 percent confident that sales in the next period will be between 5 million and 6 million units, there is still a 5 percent chance that they will be above or below that number. By understanding how likely a given risk is to occur, the business can manage the risks of a non-occurrence accordingly. Budget Forecasting\nWhen a business forecasts a budget for a fiscal period, it will need to estimate both revenues and costs. If a company is significantly off the mark on either estimation, it could get in financial trouble. By using a range of possible values for revenues and costs and finding the confidence interval of those values, a business can have the information it needs to make important financial decisions while still being able to reasonably prepare for the possibility that its estimates may be incorrect. ‒‒:‒‒\n/\n‒‒:‒‒\nReplay\nSkip\nAds by\nRead More\nReferences\nReference for Business: Confidence Interval\nUniversity of Iowa: Confidence Intervals\nYale University:', 'of plastic for each unit of a product created.

The company might predict that there is a 95 percent chance that the machine uses on average between 9.85 and 10.5 lbs. of plastic per unit. The confidence interval in this example is 95 percent, and the likelihood that the actual amount of plastic used is outside the estimated range is 5 percent. Market Research\nOne effect of confidence intervals in businesses is in determining the reliability of market research. Marketing is an important function for most firms, particularly when estimating their level of future sales. A company will want to have an idea of how many products it will sell in a given financial period, but cannot know the true number with certainty until after the end of the period. By collecting data from customers, past sales numbers and other sources, a company can statistically estimate the value of future sales.', 'If a company is significantly off the mark on either estimation, it could get in financial trouble.

In market research, they allow businesses to estimate future sales with a specified level of confidence, helping them make informed decisions about product distribution and marketing strategies. For risk management and budget forecasting, confidence intervals provide a range of possible outcomes which enables businesses to prepare for various scenarios financially, thereby minimizing potential risks associated with revenue and cost estimations being off mark.

There is no doubt that the Davosites deserve much of what has been hurled at them. They overpromised and underdelivered. Gordon Brown boasted that Britain had abolished the cycle of boom-and-bust under his leadership, only to see the global economy plunged into the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. Mr Blair championed the war in Iraq on the grounds that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, and that toppling a dictator might bring democracy to the Middle East. They engaged in a pattern of self-dealing that destroyed the bond of trust between the political elites and the masses. Since the financial crisis the likes of Messrs Blair and Osborne have grown “stinking rich” by selling their advice to global companies, while ordinary British workers have seen their wages stagnate. And they failed to learn the lessons of history. Too many Davosites think they need only make corporations a bit more woke and all will be forgiven.

Under Mr Blair the Labour Party made its peace with Margaret Thatcher’s pro-business philosophy by fawning over businesspeople. Under Mr Cameron the Conservatives made their peace with social liberalism by supporting gay marriage. The great purge of the Davosites started on the left, with Jeremy Corbyn’s election to the leadership of the Labour Party in 2015. Out went the likes of Mr Mandelson (who had once declared that “we are intensely relaxed about people becoming filthy rich”). In came hard-leftists who had learned their craft on picket lines rather than ski slopes. Mr Corbyn even advocated putting one of Davos’s heroes, Mr Blair, on trial for war crimes.', 'This columnist admits to attending the forum on several occasions and to carrying a good deal of ideological baggage.) Davosites are defined by their adamantine belief in economic and social liberalism and their position at the top of various global organisations. They support globalisation and multilateral institutions and disdain parochialism and nationalism. They idealise business and loathe nimbyism and restraints on trade.

Rolls-Royce, once one of Britain’s most respected companies, was also rated a lowly 93rd after a series of profit warnings and allegations of illegal payments that are under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. Corporate governance – how companies and boards operate and deal with shareholders, workers and customers – has shot up the political agenda amid disquiet about inequality and remote business elites.

This helps in turning large and abstract numbers into more comprehensible visual representations. 2. **Historical Context and Personal Stories**: Incorporating discussions about the conditions of trench warfare, such as the discomfort caused by rats, lice, and constant danger, adds a human element to the statistics and can evoke empathy and a deeper understanding of the toll on human lives. 3. **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing the casualty figures of World War I with other major conflicts, such as World War II, can help students grasp the scale and the devastation of the war. This approach puts the numbers into a broader historical perspective, making them more meaningful and impactful.

Reporters are calling because they’ve heard about your hot new thing and they want to talk to you about it. You start getting entrepreneur of the year awards from Harvard Business School. Investment bankers are staking out your house. This is all easier said than done, as product/market fit isn’t some clear metric you can total up, like revenue or user acquisition. This is where many startup founders get confused, and that’s why we need to go over some ways you can achieve product/market fit and then how to measure how strong it is. How to Find Product/Market Fit\nFind Your Value Hypothesis\nThe core of product/market fit is value.', 'Your job is to find the market that wants the product you are building—not the one you’ve already built. As you build the product, you need to find the people who will use it, take their feedback, and make it better until the market can’t live without your product. In the simplest terms, “product/market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.” When you fail to achieve product/market fit, the market’s answer will be clear: The customers aren’t quite getting value out of the product, word of mouth isn’t spreading, usage isn’t growing that fast, press reviews are kind of “blah”, the sales cycle takes too long, and lots of deals never close.

This involves determining a clear value proposition that is directly tailored to that customer segment as highlighted in Dan Olsen's high-level method from ""The Lean Product Playbook."" Developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and continuously testing it with your target audience will help gather crucial feedback. Metrics such as the Net Promoter Score (NPS), churn rate, growth rate, and market share can quantitatively assess how well your product is fitting within its intended market. Additionally, qualitative indicators like significant word-of-mouth, increased media coverage, and strong competitive positioning further validate product-market fit. To continue improving, consider enhancing your product based on customer feedback until it becomes indispensable to the market.

Some of them absolutely forbid it. The Roman Catholic church, for example, is one of the most active organisations in opposing euthanasia. Virtually all religions state that those who become vulnerable through illness or disability deserve special care and protection, and that proper end of life care is a much better thing than euthanasia. Religions are opposed to euthanasia for a number of reasons. God has forbidden it\nvirtually all religions with a supreme God have a command from God in their scriptures that says 'you must not kill'\nthis is usually interpreted as meaning 'you must not kill innocent human beings'\nthis rules out euthanasia (and suicide) as well as murder, as carrying out any of these would be against God's orders, and would be an attack on the sovereignity of God\nHuman life is sacred\nhuman lives are special because God created them\ntherefore human life should be protected and preserved, whatever happens\ntherefore we shouldn't interfere with God's plans by shortening human lives\nHuman life is special\nhuman beings are made in God's image\ntherefore they have a special value and dignity\nthis value doesn't depend on the quality of a particular life\ntaking a life violates that special value and dignity\neven if it's one's own life\neven if that life is full of pain and suffering\nEastern religions\nSome Eastern religions take a different approach. The key ideas in their attitudes to death are achieving freedom from mortal life, and not-harming living beings.""]";Views on euthanasia vary significantly between Western and Eastern perspectives, reflecting diverse religious and cultural contexts. In the West, religions like Roman Catholicism strictly oppose euthanasia, with the Church actively working against it on the grounds that life is sacred and should not be artificially shortened. On the other hand, Eastern religions such as Shinto in Japan show a more accepting stance towards passive forms of euthanasia, with a significant proportion of religious organizations supporting voluntary passive euthanasia, viewing the prolongation of life through artificial means unfavorably.

The flexibility of this tool means that it possesses several uses in the classroom, such as for teachers explaining work to students in lessons, and devising future lesson plans and revision guides. Using mind mapping software in the classroom is also a successful way to support children’s exploration and presentation of ideas. In a study, Ralston and Cook (2007)8 found that an exercise involving mind mapping software provided a useful focus for pupils to organize their thoughts and to present information clearly and attractively. It also facilitated communication between pupils. Ayoa’s mind mapping tools are flexible and easy to use, making them a great aid for educators and students at all levels. A teacher from Ysgol Gyfun Bro Morgannwg School in Wales in the UK has noted that: “ [ Mind mapping in] iMindMap [now Ayoa] facilitates teachers when explaining work as they can pictorially represent a lesson plan, while for students it encourages freedom of expression when planning their work.” Planning and organization\nEvidence shows that mind mapping can be used to help you plan and organize your thinking before you start writing or get stuck into a project.

Finally, Yeltsin would have to pursue policies that ensured that Russia found a prominent ""place at the table,"" to ensure safeguarding not only of its traditional interests, but of its concerns relating to the new dangers of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, ethno-religious conflict, and terrorism. To determine the shape of Boris Yeltsin\'s foreign policy legacy and to assess the impact of his personality on Russian foreign policy of the past decade, we now proceed to summarize Yeltsin\'s record in responding to each of these challenges.6\nBasic Concepts of Foreign Policy under Yeltsin\nBoris Yeltsin\'s primary aim in foreign policy, like Mikhail Gorbachev\'s before him, was to create a non-threatening external environment that would be most conducive to his country\'s internal economic and political development. As in the early decades of Soviet rule, this concentration on domestic development, together with relative shortcomings in military strength, produced a foreign policy of accommodation, retrenchment, and risk-avoidance--at least, in Russia\'s relations with states beyond the borders of the former USSR. The fall of the CPSU and its Marxist-Leninist ideology, together with the disintegration of the USSR itself, left a conceptual void in the foreign policy of the newly-independent Russian Federation that raised to the forefront the question of Russia\'s national identity. Russia had never existed as a nation-state; rather, during both the Tsarist and Soviet periods it had been a multinational empire with messianic ambitions. Unlike other European imperial states, the modern Russian nation was not formed prior to the period of colonial expansion. Moreover, the tsars, unlike the rulers of Britain or France, colonized lands that bordered their home territories, thus producing an unusual intermixing of Russian and non-Russian peoples.7 Further complicating the definition of Russia\'s national identity is the fact that twenty-five million ethnic Russians live outside the Russian Federation, in the other newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. Not only are the people of the Russian Federation experiencing new geopolitical confines, but they are also acutely aware of the relative weakness of their state, in comparison to the superpower status enjoyed by the USSR at the height of its power.', 'The foreign policy record of his administration fairly clearly demonstrated the impact of his personal leadership, as he guided the choice of key personnel, reduced the role of the party bureaucracy, discarded outdated Marxist-Leninist tenets, and conducted an innovative personal diplomacy.4\nGorbachev\'s experiment in perestroika was an immense failure, resulting in the collapse of the political institutions of the USSR and the breakup of the country itself. Stepping into this precarious environment, which decidedly ""admitted of restructuring,"" Boris Yeltsin clearly occupied the strategic location from which he could exert far-reaching impact on the foreign policy of his newly established realm. In Greenstein\'s framework, it was the third variable that would prove decisive. On Yeltsin\'s political skills--the strengths and weaknesses of his personality--would ultimately depend the determination of his personal impact as a leader. He was destined by his situation for greatness; but in Sidney Hook\'s terms, his personal skills would determine whether he would go down in history as a Great Man or a Great Failure.5\nAlthough Gorbachev had set a new direction and forged new relationships, the foreign policy challenges facing Yeltsin demanded considerable leadership skill. To him fell the unique opportunity of defining a new national identity for Russia and establishing the basic concept for its national security. Moreover, with the collapse of the long-dominant Communist Party, he would need to build the new institutions that would shape foreign policy. Like Gorbachev\'s, his foreign policy could help set the direction for economic and social changes in the country and could gain the foreign assistance that might spark its recovery from a long downward slide. A totally new challenge lay in establishing relationships of trust and mutual assistance with the fourteen other ""newly independent states"" that emerged from the Soviet collapse.', 'but in Sidney Hook\'s terms, his personal skills would determine whether he would go down in history as a Great Man or a Great Failure.5\nAlthough Gorbachev had set a new direction and forged new relationships, the foreign policy challenges facing Yeltsin demanded considerable leadership skill.

Like Gorbachev\'s, his foreign policy could help set the direction for economic and social changes in the country and could gain the foreign assistance that might spark its recovery from a long downward slide. A totally new challenge lay in establishing relationships of trust and mutual assistance with the fourteen other ""newly independent states"" that emerged from the Soviet collapse. Russia\'s new constructive relationships with the West were not yet solidified, and immediate attention to the ""non-West"" would be required to reduce threats to the security of the borders of Russia and her new neighbors. Finally, Yeltsin would have to pursue policies that ensured that Russia found a prominent ""place at the table,"" to ensure safeguarding not only of its traditional interests, but of its concerns relating to the new dangers of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, ethno-religious conflict, and terrorism. To determine the shape of Boris Yeltsin\'s foreign policy legacy and to assess the impact of his personality on Russian foreign policy of the past decade, we now proceed to summarize Yeltsin\'s record in responding to each of these challenges.6\nBasic Concepts of Foreign Policy under Yeltsin\nBoris Yeltsin\'s primary aim in foreign policy, like Mikhail Gorbachev\'s before him, was to create a non-threatening external environment that would be most conducive to his country\'s internal economic and political development. As in the early decades of Soviet rule, this concentration on domestic development, together with relative shortcomings in military strength, produced a foreign policy of accommodation, retrenchment, and risk-avoidance--at least, in Russia\'s relations with states beyond the borders of the former USSR. The fall of the CPSU and its Marxist-Leninist ideology, together with the disintegration of the USSR itself, left a conceptual void in the foreign policy of the newly-independent Russian Federation that raised to the forefront the question of Russia\'s national identity.', ""The crisis ended after troops loyal to Yeltsin stormed the parliament building and stopped an armed uprising; he then introduced a new constitution which significantly expanded the powers of the president. Secessionist sentiment in the Russian Caucasus led to the First Chechen War, War of Dagestan, and Second Chechen War between 1994 and 1999. Internationally, Yeltsin promoted renewed collaboration with Europe and signed arms control agreements with the United States. Amid growing internal pressure, he resigned by the end of 1999 and was succeeded by his chosen successor, former Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Out of office, he kept a low profile, but he was accorded a state funeral following his death in April 2007. Yeltsin was a controversial figure. Domestically, he was highly popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s, although his reputation was damaged by the economic and political crises of his presidency, and he left office widely unpopular with the Russian population. He received praise and criticism for his role in dismantling the Soviet Union, transforming Russia into a representative democracy, and introducing new political, economic, and cultural freedoms to the country. Conversely, he was accused of economic mismanagement, overseeing a massive growth in inequality and corruption, and sometimes of undermining Russia's standing as a major world power."", ""bɐˈrʲis nʲɪkɐˈlaɪvʲɪtɕ ˈjelʲtsɨn] ( listen); 1 February 1931 – 23 April 2007) was a Russian and former Soviet politician who served as the first President of Russia from 1991 to 1999. A member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1961 to 1990, he later stood as a political independent, during which time he was viewed as being ideologically aligned with liberalism and Russian nationalism . Born in Butka, Sverdlovsk Oblast, to a peasant family, Yeltsin grew up in Kazan, Tatar ASSR. After studying at the Ural State Technical University, he worked in construction. Joining the Communist Party, which governed the Soviet Union as a one-party state according to Marxist–Leninist doctrine, he rose through its ranks and in 1976 became First Secretary of the party's Sverdlovsk Oblast committee. Initially a supporter of the perestroika reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Yeltsin later criticized them as being too moderate, calling for a transition to a multi-party representative democracy. In 1987 he was the first person to resign from the party's governing Politburo, establishing his popularity as an anti-establishment figure. In 1990, he was elected chair of the Russian Supreme Soviet and in 1991 was elected president of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). Allying with various non-Russian nationalist leaders, he was instrumental in the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union in December that year, at which the RSFSR became the Russian Federation, an independent state.""]";The passage does not directly address how non-aligned countries were specifically affected by Boris Yeltsin's policies or tenure. However, it does mention that Yeltsin focused on creating a non-threatening external environment and had a foreign policy characterized by accommodation, retrenchment, and risk-avoidance, particularly in Russia's relations with states outside the former USSR. This approach suggests that non-aligned countries might have experienced a less aggressive and more cooperative Russia during Yeltsin's presidency. Additionally, the passage notes Yeltsin's interest in addressing security concerns and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, which could imply efforts to engage constructively on global security issues that would also affect non-aligned nations. However, specific impacts on non-aligned countries from these broader strategies are not detailed in the given passage.;['Collapse of USSR impacted non-aligned nations', 'Reduced Soviet influence on non-aligned states', 'Non-aligned nations navigated new landscape', 'Rise of new global powers reshaped alliances', 'Yeltsin prioritized Russia’s interests', 'Less Soviet intervention in non-aligned affairs', 'End of Cold War affected non-aligned states', 'New opportunities and challenges emerged', 'Russia’s foreign policy shifted after USSR collapse', 'Non-aligned movement lost a major player', 'New relationships formed with former Soviet republics', 'Economic impact varied across non-aligned nations', 'Political realignment among non-aligned states', 'Increased competition for influence in non-aligned world', 'Yeltsin’s actions impacted global power dynamics', 'Non-aligned nations adapted to changing world order', 'Impact on non-aligned nations varied widely', 'Increased global multipolarity'];['vital', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'vital', 'okay', 'okay'];['partial_support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support', 'not_support', 'support', 'partial_support', 'partial_support', 'not_support'];0.0
